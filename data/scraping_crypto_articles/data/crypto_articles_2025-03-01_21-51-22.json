        "title": "Tariffs, trade tensions, and the Bitcoin mining industry",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from Jill Ford, Founder of Bitford Digital. The ongoing turbulence in global trade policies has sent shockwaves through multiple industries, and Bitcoin mining is no exception. Many in the crypto mining sector are now grappling with the impact of these tariffs as they come into sharper focus.  Some are already dealing with sudden customs delays, cost increases and shortages all while trying to make sense of evolving international trade agreements. With shipments of mining equipment already stuck at borders, uncertainty is growing among miners, suppliers, and investors. One of the primary concerns facing Bitcoin miners today is the unpredictability surrounding the new Trump administration’s barrage of tariffs and the seemingly arbitrary border enforcement policies that accompany them. I have personally seen first-hand how mining equipment is now being held in customs without clear explanations. Some shipments have been stuck at U.S. borders since November, with no resolution in sight. While some shipments pass through relatively smoothly, others face arbitrary delays, making it increasingly difficult for mining operations to plan and scale. A client recently shared an incident where 110 mining machines were held in customs without any clear justification. The unpredictability and lack of clarity around border enforcement is leaving businesses with mounting costs, operational setbacks, and more questions than answers. Bitcoin mining relies on specialized hardware known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), the vast majority of which—nearly 98%—are produced by Chinese manufacturers like Bitmain. This dominance gives China a near-monopoly over the market, leaving U.S. miners vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and shifting regulatory enforcement. Recently, heightened customs scrutiny—fueled by tariffs and reliance on Chinese imports—has created significant delays and uncertainty for mining operations. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has increased inspections to ensure compliance with trade regulations, but another major hurdle has emerged: many ASIC miners reportedly fail to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) equipment authorization rules. These regulations require any device emitting radio-frequency energy to undergo testing and certification before being imported or sold in the U.S. Additionally, some mining rigs contain AI chips from Sophgo, a Chinese company under U.S. trade restrictions, raising national security concerns. Complicating matters further, discrepancies in country-of-origin labeling have created additional hurdles. In one instance, a shipment of mining machines made in Thailand was flagged at the U.S.-Canada border after customs officials questioned the legitimacy of the origin labels. Given the stark difference in tariffs—2.6% for Thai-made equipment versus 27% for Chinese-made hardware—such scrutiny adds another layer of complexity, even when businesses provide proper documentation. Despite positioning himself as a pro-crypto candidate, President Trump’s trade policies have presented challenges for Bitcoin miners. While his administration has taken a favorable stance on digital assets, tariffs and trade restrictions have become a double-edged sword for the industry. Ongoing negotiations with China, Mexico, and Canada have left businesses uncertain about the future of their supply chains. Tariffs on Chinese imports—intended to protect American manufacturing—have unintentionally driven up costs for U.S.-based miners by making essential hardware more expensive. Adding to the uncertainty, the temporary suspension of shipments from China by the U.S. Postal Service highlighted the volatility of trade policies. Though the restriction was later lifted, it underscored the unpredictability of logistics, forcing businesses to scramble for alternatives. While Trump’s policies have created short-term pain for Bitcoin miners, they have also spurred a broader discussion about the need for domestic mining hardware production. The push for U.S.-made ASICs is about more than just economics; it ties into larger concerns around supply chain resilience, national security, and technological sovereignty. If the U.S. could develop its own mining hardware industry, it would reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturers and create domestic jobs. Texas, already a hotspot for Bitcoin mining due to its low energy costs, is a prime candidate to become a hub for ASIC production. Additionally, initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated billions to boost semiconductor manufacturing, could indirectly support efforts to establish a domestic Bitcoin hardware industry. However, manufacturing mining hardware in the U.S. comes with significant hurdles. The cost of production is a major barrier, as labor and material expenses are much higher than in China. Although government incentives and automation could help bridge the gap, competing with well-established Chinese manufacturers will take time and investment. Another issue is expertise. The U.S. currently lacks the infrastructure and specialized knowledge needed to produce ASIC miners at scale. Developing this capability will require strategic partnerships, research initiatives, and a long-term commitment from both the private sector and policymakers. Finally, there’s the environmental factor. Mining already faces scrutiny for its energy consumption, and hardware manufacturing could attract similar criticism. However, if U.S. producers prioritize sustainable materials and renewable energy, they could set a new global standard for responsible crypto infrastructure. With international trade restrictions creating uncertainty, some mining equipment manufacturers are exploring domestic production. Bitmain, for example, is set to open a manufacturing facility in the U.S. This move could help mitigate some of the supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs and customs delays. Other brands, such as Whatsminer and Ardyne, are also being closely watched. While U.S.-made mining hardware may help reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, the current cost of domestically manufactured equipment remains significantly higher than imported alternatives. As the industry evolves, it remains to be seen whether domestic production can compete with overseas manufacturers in both price and efficiency. Trump’s trade policies have already disrupted the Bitcoin mining industry, but they’ve also accelerated discussions about the need for self-sufficiency in mining hardware. In the short term, tariffs have driven up costs and created new hurdles for U.S.-based miners. However, in the long run, these policies could act as a catalyst for reshaping the industry—pushing the U.S. toward greater resilience and independence in the crypto economy. If the push for American-made mining hardware gains traction, it could mark a pivotal shift, positioning the U.S. as a leader in Bitcoin infrastructure rather than a passive participant. The road ahead won’t be easy, but the potential benefits—for the industry, the economy, and the broader financial system—make this a goal worth pursuing. For Bitcoin miners and investors, staying informed is critical as shifting trade policies and regulatory uncertainty continue to impact market dynamics. The industry must adapt, whether through alternative supply chains, domestic production, or increased lobbying efforts. Most importantly, the Trump administration itself must bring clarity to its tariff policies and border regulations. Clear communication and a predictable process are essential, ensuring that any unintended consequences—particularly for Bitcoin miners and the broader crypto sector—are recognized and addressed accordingly.

        "description": "Hayden Adams criticized the advisory group for being a symbolic gesture that does not allay the community's recent concerns.",
        "content": "Uniswap founder Hayden Adams criticized the newly founded Ethereum Foundation’s (EF) advisory group, titled “Silviculture Society.” He said the initiative was not what the community was looking for and called on the Foundation to improve its communication by taking a clearer and more direct approach. He said in a Feb. 28 X post: “Honest, direct feedback: flowery language and a counsel of random people on twitter is not what people have been asking for.” Adams added that he is not criticizing the 15 names chosen for the advisory group but rather the idea and message behind the initiative, which he believes does not allay the community’s recent concerns. The Ethereum community has voiced concerns over the perceived disconnect between the Foundation’s current initiatives and the practical, transparent communication they expect. There is also unease about the ongoing structural changes and treasury management practices, which many feel have direct implications on ETH’s market performance. According to an EF statement, the Silviculture Society comprises names from outside the Foundation who have been picked to provide “informal counsel.” The goal is to ensure the Foundation maintains its “core values of open source, privacy, security, and censorship resistance.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s (ETH) co-founder, responded to Adams’ post, saying: “It is an experimental effort to create more channels for builders and other community voices to influence the EF, and in this case the scope is core cypherpunk and regen values. They have already given advice on timely and critical topics such as wallet security.” He added that the EF does not pay the Silviculture Society, and the group has a one-year term. Additionally, Buterin shared that more initiatives and structures will be formed to capture community feedback. Following Buterin’s explanation, Adams called the initiative “reasonable.” However, reiterated that EF needs to communicate in a “more direct and clear” format like Buterin’s response. The creation of the Silviculture Society comes amid a broad movement to restructure the Ethereum Foundation, which has consequently led to concerns among the community regarding its stability and long-term vision. On Feb. 25, Aya Miyaguchi stepped down from her role as EF executive director and moved to a new position as the Foundation’s president. The Foundation has yet to name a replacement. Miyaguchi and Buterin also mentioned creating a new “leadership structure” for EF but did not share further details about the plan. The community has scrutinized the EF over the past few months for ETH’s underperformance in 2024 compared to other major cryptocurrencies. The frequent selling of ETH raised questions about the effectiveness of the EF’s treasury management, as the public realization of these assets has impacted ETH’s price.

        "description": "Jeremy Allaire calls for US registration of stablecoins amid expanding dollar-pegged asset market and regulatory concerns.",
        "content": "Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire has called for US dollar-pegged stablecoin issuers to be registered in the United States, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity as lawmakers introduce new legislation on digital assets. Allaire made the statement during a Bloomberg interview on Feb. 26 amid growing discussions in Washington over stablecoin oversight, a key issue in shaping the future of crypto regulation. The call for formal registration aligns with efforts by some policymakers to bring stablecoin issuers under a clear legal framework, particularly as the market for dollar-pegged digital assets expands. Stablecoins play a significant role in digital asset markets, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. However, regulatory uncertainty has persisted, with questions about reserve backing, consumer protections, and financial stability risks. Earlier this month, Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced a bill aimed at creating a federal framework for stablecoin regulation. The legislation is among the first crypto-related measures expected to be debated under President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump has signaled support for positioning the US as a leader in the crypto industry, setting the stage for potential regulatory shifts that could impact stablecoin issuers like Circle. Circle’s USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, following Tether Limited’s USDT. The firm has positioned itself as a more transparent and regulatory-compliant issuer compared to its rivals. The company has long advocated for a clear legal framework that would allow stablecoins to operate within the US financial system rather than in regulatory gray areas. However, some argue that this could potentially hamper innovation and competition in a global market. Allaire’s call for US registration aligns with broader industry efforts to establish trust and stability in the market. While some lawmakers and regulators have expressed concerns about stablecoins’ potential impact on financial stability, others argue that well-regulated issuers could enhance payment efficiency and innovation. With stablecoins now central to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the ongoing debate over their regulation is likely to shape the future of digital finance in the U.S. Whether Hagerty’s bill gains traction or undergoes significant revisions, the push for clarity in stablecoin oversight marks a crucial moment for both the industry and policymakers.

        "description": "The asset manager allocated 1% to 2% in Bitcoin through its IBIT exchange-traded fund.",
        "content": "BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin (BTC) into its $150 billion model-portfolio offerings through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 28. The asset manager has assigned 1% to 2% of its target allocation portfolios to IBIT. As of Dec. 17, the fund registered over $36 billion in net flows, amassing more inflows than any ETF launched since 2014. According to the report, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility prompted BlackRock, in a December report from the BlackRock Investment Institute, to define a 1% to 2% allocation as a “reasonable range.” The document noted that exceeding a 2% allocation could disproportionately increase the cryptocurrency’s impact on overall portfolio risk. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, stated: “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” Additionally, Eve Cout, head of portfolio design and solutions for US Wealth at BlackRock, noted that investors want to allocate more to alternatives. Still, they need guidance on the position’s size, scale, and rebalance. The decision comes amid IBIT registering $930 million in outflows in the past four days. On Feb. 26, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF experienced its largest daily outflow, with $418 million in capital leaving the fund. Despite the recent woes, IBIT currently holds over $48 billion in assets and displays nearly $40 billion in net flows per data from Bold Report and Farside Investors. Notably, the firm doubled its Bitcoin exposure in its Global Allocation Fund last year, reporting 430,770 shares of IBIT in its third-quarter 13F Form. The amount was 117% larger than the 198,874 shares reported for the second quarter. BlackRock’s addition of Bitcoin to its model portfolio is a much-needed positive development that could boost market sentiment amid falling prices.

        "description": "As Ukraine's crypto bill nears a vote, lawmakers grapple with crafting equitable taxation to foster industry growth.",
        "content": "Ukraine is advancing efforts to legalize crypto, with lawmakers expected to vote on a long-awaited bill in the coming months, local media reported on Feb. 28. However, uncertainty remains over how digital assets will be taxed, a key issue that could impact the country’s growing crypto sector. Ukraine is exploring a crypto tax rate between 5% and 10% as part of its broader efforts to regulate the digital asset market while generating revenue for the state budget and military funding. However, officials are also considering applying the standard taxation framework, which would impose an 18% income tax plus a 5% military levy, bringing the total tax burden on crypto earnings to 23%. The final decision remains under discussion as lawmakers work toward passing a comprehensive regulatory framework, with legislation expected to be finalized by mid-2025. Danil Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s finance, tax, and customs committee, said he expects the legislation’s first reading by the end of March and a second reading soon after. If the bill moves forward as planned, it could be enacted by mid-2025. However, some officials remain skeptical about the timeline. Taras Kozak, a member of the Kyiv City Council and president of the investment group “UNIVER,” suggested the process may take longer. Kozak said in an interview: “I’m optimistic that the bill will pass by the end of the year, but full legalization and taxation will likely come into effect in 2026.” Ukraine has emerged as a leader in crypto adoption, with digital assets playing a vital role in financial transactions and donations since Russia’s invasion in 2022. The country has embraced blockchain technology to support its economy, but legal uncertainties have hindered mainstream integration. The pending legislation aims to establish clear guidelines for the use and taxation of cryptocurrencies. While the exact tax structure has yet to be finalized, officials have hinted at a possible flat-rate tax or a tiered system based on trading volume. Kozak said that “Ukraine needs a competitive regulatory framework” and warned that overly complex taxation could push businesses and investors toward offshore platforms. Despite strong political support, the process has faced delays. In 2021, Ukraine passed a law recognizing cryptocurrencies, but it required additional amendments to align with EU standards. The current bill seeks to address those gaps, ensuring compliance with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing regulations. Hetmantsev emphasized the urgency of passing the legislation, arguing that delays could hinder Ukraine’s ability to attract foreign investment in blockchain-based industries. He said: “We are doing everything possible to expedite the process.” If the law is enacted, Ukraine will join a growing list of countries formally integrating digital assets into their financial and tax systems. However, industry leaders stress that taxation policies will play a crucial role in determining whether the market flourishes or struggles under regulatory pressure.

United States President Donald Trump is set to host the first-ever White House crypto summit on March 7, 2025. The event is expected to bring together key figures in the industry, including investors, CEOs, and government officials. This marks a significant move for Trump, who has previously been critical of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Trump’s crypto summit will include discussions with high-profile figures from the digital asset sector. Members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets will also be present.

Many in the industry have been pushing for clearer regulations. With this summit, Trump appears to be listening to those calls. The discussions will likely cover regulatory policies, innovation, and potential economic impacts of crypto. Trump made no secret of his doubts about Bitcoin during his first administration. He labeled it a scam in 2019 and claimed it was based on a fictitious story. His readiness to host a crypto symposium now points to a more flexible strategy. Although his team has not yet disclosed specific policy changes, holding an event of this nature suggests that things may be about to change. With regard to cryptocurrency regulations, the Biden administration had adopted a more stringent stance, stepping up oversight of exchanges and enforcing compliance guidelines. Trump might make the US more business-friendly for cryptocurrency companies if he took a more positive stand. The Trump business enterprise is also looking into the world of digital assets, not just politics. Today, the Trump Organization applied for a trademark for the word “TRUMP” in order to start an NFT and metaverse trading tool. This shows that Trump thinks blockchain-based companies can be useful. Traders have had a range of responses to NFTs and metaverse projects. There are people who think they are the future of internet ownership and people who don’t. With his move to get involved in this area, Trump’s relationship with cryptocurrency is changing in more ways than one. Trump’s summit may help to clarify the current regulatory discussions. Leaders in the industry anticipate stronger growth prospects and more benevolent policies. How much of an impact the meeting will have on actual laws and regulations is yet unknown, though. The event is anticipated to garner a lot of attention and will take place in Washington, D.C. This could be a turning point for the US crypto business, as regulations are still a heated topic.

        "description": "Bitcoin below $85K, Coinbase Premium negative, signaling U.S. spot selling. Bear market fears rise. Will BTC recover or see further declines?",
        "content": "Bitcoin is trading below the $85K mark as the entire market struggles to hold above key demand levels. The recent sell-off has triggered panic selling and increased speculation about the future of BTC, with many investors fearing that a prolonged bear market could be on the horizon. The rapid price drop has shaken confidence, and sentiment remains deeply bearish across the crypto industry. Key data from Coinglass reveals that BTC’s Coinbase Premium has retreated into the negative territory recently. This indicates a surge in spot selling over the past few days, which aligns with the large ETF outflows and overall bearish price action. Historically, a negative Coinbase Premium suggests that U.S. investors are offloading BTC at a discount compared to other global exchanges, reinforcing the growing fear in the market. For Bitcoin to recover, the premium must turn positive again, signaling renewed spot demand. Until then, the market remains fragile, with analysts closely watching whether BTC can reclaim key resistance levels or if further downside is imminent. The coming days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s next move as investors await signs of stability amid growing uncertainty. Bitcoin is trading around $85K as the broader crypto market, particularly altcoins and meme coins, continues to face extreme selling pressure. BTC has lost critical weekly support around the $90K level, and volatility remains a key factor in short-term price action. Bulls must defend current demand zones to prevent further declines and initiate a potential recovery phase. Crypto analyst Daan shared Coinglass data on X, revealing that BTC’s Coinbase Premium has gone into the negative zone recently. This suggests that a significant amount of spot selling has occurred over the past few days, aligning with large ETF outflows and a prevailing bearish sentiment. Historically, when the Coinbase Premium turns negative, it indicates that US-based traders are offloading BTC at a discount compared to other exchanges, reflecting a lack of confidence in short-term price action. For Bitcoin to bounce back strongly, the Coinbase Premium must return to positive territory, signaling renewed spot demand. Currently, the premium is attempting to recover following the recent bounce, suggesting that some buying pressure is returning. However, Daan cautions that he will be monitoring this trend closely to determine whether it sustains over the coming days. The next key resistance levels lie around $88K–$90K, and a push above these levels could confirm a bullish recovery. However, if selling pressure persists and BTC fails to reclaim lost ground, the price may continue consolidating or even drop further. The coming days will be crucial in defining Bitcoin’s next move as the market navigates ongoing volatility and uncertainty. Bitcoin is trading at $84,900, sitting below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) but still holding above the 200-day moving average (MA). The price has dropped 18% since Monday, marking one of the most significant corrections of the year. Bulls are struggling to reclaim key demand levels, and market sentiment remains cautious as investors monitor price action for signs of a recovery. If BTC holds above the $85K level in the coming days, bulls could attempt to push the price toward $88K, a short-term resistance level that needs to be reclaimed for a potential recovery rally. However, the lack of strong demand at current levels is a concern, as bearish momentum has dominated the market in recent sessions. On the downside, a break below $85K would indicate further weakness and could lead to a deeper correction into lower demand levels. Key support areas to watch in case of a breakdown include $82K and $80K, where buyers may look to step in. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can stabilize and initiate a rebound or if further downside movement is on the horizon. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

RedStone is designed to provide scalable and reliable data feeds across EVM and non-EVM blockchains, improving the efficiency of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The farming phase on Binance Launchpool for RED tokens began on February 26, 2025, allowing users to stake BNB, FDUSD, and USDC to receive RED rewards. Binance launched Pre-Market trading for RED on February 28, 2025, allowing users to trade RED/USDT before its official spot listing. The Pre-Market phase gives traders the opportunity to buy and sell RED with limited price volatility before the open market listing. To ensure price stability in the early trading phase, Binance has implemented a Price Cap Mechanism for the first 72 hours of Pre-Market trading: Additionally, Binance has set a maximum holding limit of 5,000 RED per user during the Pre-Market phase. Trading on Binance, including Pre-Market, can lead to an increase in trading fees due to high volatility and market activity. To reduce costs, new users can sign up using a Binance referral code to receive up to 20% off trading fees and access additional benefits. Trading new tokens on a secure and high-liquidity exchange is crucial, and Binance remains the top choice for both new and experienced traders. With deep liquidity, low fees, and advanced security, Binance offers an optimal trading environment for RED and other emerging assets. If you’re considering trading on Binance, a detailed Binance review explores its features, including security, fees, and available trading options."
