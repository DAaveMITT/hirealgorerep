In a statement released on Feb. 24, the EU identified Garantex as a key player in facilitating Russia’s efforts to bypass financial restrictions. The council cited the exchange’s close association with Russian banks already under EU sanctions as a primary reason for the measure. This move marks the first time the EU has directly sanctioned a Russian crypto exchange. The EU’s latest sanctions seek to limit Russia’s access to financial resources and disrupt its ability to fund military operations. By targeting Garantex, the EU aims to close financial loopholes that enable Russia to circumvent economic restrictions through crypto. Notably, CryptoSlate previously reported that Russians had turned to digital assets like Bitcoin and Tether’s USDT to neutralize the impact of Western sanctions on its economy. Meanwhile, the package includes restrictions on 48 individuals and 35 entities, increasing the total number of sanctioned persons and organizations to over 2,400. The EU stated that these sanctioned entities actively support Russia’s war efforts. As a result, their assets are now frozen, and EU citizens and businesses are prohibited from conducting transactions with them. Additionally, individuals on the list face travel bans, restricting their movement within EU member states. Beyond Garantex, the sanctions apply to Russian oil transport companies, a Chinese satellite imaging firm, media propagandists, business figures, and political entities. These measures aim to tighten economic and financial pressure on Russia’s war-linked networks. This action against Garantex follows prior restrictions imposed by the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2024, investigators in both countries were examining the exchange’s role in processing approximately $20 billion USDT. Before that, the US Treasury accused Garantex of failing to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations, which allowed illicit transactions to occur on its platform. As a result. the exchange’s wallets are now listed on the US Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Gaussian Channel Support Points To Potential Price Reversal', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/solanas-uptrend-in-sight/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': "Solana's Uptrend In Sight? Gaussian Channel Support Points To Potential Price Reversal | Bitcoinist.com", 'description': "Crypto expert, Trader Tardigrade identify an encouraging trend on Solana's chart, with a bullish pattern providing strong support for the price.", 'content': 'Solana is caught in a period of continued bearish performance due to the notable decline in the broader crypto market, with its price plummeting by nearly 23% in the past week. After this robust downward move over the past few days, the altcoin might be set for a price recovery as promising trends unfold on SOL’s chart. Optimism blooms again as Solana displays potential for an upside momentum following a heightened volatile period. Crypto expert and investor Trader Tardigrade identify an encouraging trend on SOL’s chart, with a bullish pattern providing strong support for the price. SOL, which has experienced substantial selling pressure, is currently trading close to crucial technical areas that could alter its price trajectory. Trader Tardigrade highlighted that SOL had formed a Gaussian Channel pattern on the weekly time frame, which signals growing momentum. It is worth noting that the mid-band of the Gaussian Channel formation is providing support for Solana. At this point, the crypto expert highlighted that the altcoin‘s downward trend is expected to slow down or witness a price reversal. However, whether Solana can overcome key resistance levels and move higher again will also depend on continued momentum and strong buying demand. Meanwhile, certain developments such as meme coins fatigue and the massive $1.7 billion SOL token unlock this weekend present robust bearish pressure for the asset. While these developments may hint at impending bearish pressure, Trader Tardigrade remains optimistic about SOL’s long-term performance. The expert’s bullish sentiment is backed by the Solana ecosystem’s persistent growth and recovery from supply disruptions in the past. Given the present volatility in SOL’s price, on-chain metrics reveal that investors seem to be in a state of fear. This shift in investors’ sentiment is evidenced by a sharp reduction in large SOL investors, commonly regarded as whale holders. Seasoned technical analyst and trader Ali Martinez reported a decline in wallet addresses holding more than 10,000 SOL in the past month. The drop raises concerns about whether these large investors are repositioning or taking profits as they await possible price rebounds. Such weak investors’ sentiment puts SOL’s price at risk of witnessing an extension of its downward movements to lower levels. Investors’ waning confidence and interest are also reflected by a sharp decline in SOL transfer volume, indicating reduced network activity. A decrease in transfer volume implies a lower demand for transactions on the Solana blockchain. Data from Ali Martinez shows that SOL transfer volume has fallen from a whopping $1.99 billion to a mere $14.57 million. This sharp decline took place in the space of 3 months, particularly since November last year. As the altcoin holds key support levels, this development questions the sustainability of its position above these zones.'}

2025-02-27 12:32:42,148 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Solana’s Uptrend In Sight? Gaussian Channel Support Points To Potential Price Reversal', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/solanas-uptrend-in-sight/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': "Solana's Uptrend In Sight? Gaussian Channel Support Points To Potential Price Reversal | Bitcoinist.com", 'description': "Crypto expert, Trader Tardigrade identify an encouraging trend on Solana's chart, with a bullish pattern providing strong support for the price.", 'content': 'Solana is caught in a period of continued bearish performance due to the notable decline in the broader crypto market, with its price plummeting by nearly 23% in the past week. After this robust downward move over the past few days, the altcoin might be set for a price recovery as promising trends unfold on SOL’s chart. Optimism blooms again as Solana displays potential for an upside momentum following a heightened volatile period. Crypto expert and investor Trader Tardigrade identify an encouraging trend on SOL’s chart, with a bullish pattern providing strong support for the price. SOL, which has experienced substantial selling pressure, is currently trading close to crucial technical areas that could alter its price trajectory. Trader Tardigrade highlighted that SOL had formed a Gaussian Channel pattern on the weekly time frame, which signals growing momentum. It is worth noting that the mid-band of the Gaussian Channel formation is providing support for Solana. At this point, the crypto expert highlighted that the altcoin‘s downward trend is expected to slow down or witness a price reversal. However, whether Solana can overcome key resistance levels and move higher again will also depend on continued momentum and strong buying demand. Meanwhile, certain developments such as meme coins fatigue and the massive $1.7 billion SOL token unlock this weekend present robust bearish pressure for the asset. While these developments may hint at impending bearish pressure, Trader Tardigrade remains optimistic about SOL’s long-term performance. The expert’s bullish sentiment is backed by the Solana ecosystem’s persistent growth and recovery from supply disruptions in the past. Given the present volatility in SOL’s price, on-chain metrics reveal that investors seem to be in a state of fear. This shift in investors’ sentiment is evidenced by a sharp reduction in large SOL investors, commonly regarded as whale holders. Seasoned technical analyst and trader Ali Martinez reported a decline in wallet addresses holding more than 10,000 SOL in the past month. The drop raises concerns about whether these large investors are repositioning or taking profits as they await possible price rebounds. Such weak investors’ sentiment puts SOL’s price at risk of witnessing an extension of its downward movements to lower levels. Investors’ waning confidence and interest are also reflected by a sharp decline in SOL transfer volume, indicating reduced network activity. A decrease in transfer volume implies a lower demand for transactions on the Solana blockchain. Data from Ali Martinez shows that SOL transfer volume has fallen from a whopping $1.99 billion to a mere $14.57 million. This sharp decline took place in the space of 3 months, particularly since November last year. As the altcoin holds key support levels, this development questions the sustainability of its position above these zones.'}

The proposed legislation, known as the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, has gained support from multiple Democratic colleagues and is designed to “make corruption criminal again.” If passed, the bill would prohibit elected officials like the president, vice president, members of Congress, and senior executive officials — along with their spouses and dependent children—from issuing, promoting, or financially benefiting from securities, commodities, or cryptocurrencies, including memecoins. The lawmaker also views the bill as an expansion of the Emoluments Clause, which prevents officials from accepting gifts from foreign entities. He argued that profiting from political influence in financial markets should be equally restricted. Additionally, it would penalize violators and require them to forfeit any illicit gains made before the bill’s enactment. Liccardo said he introduced the MEME Act following the controversial launch of TRUMP, a memecoin linked to President Donald Trump. According to him: “The tokens raised a lot concerns among folks about conflict of interest, about exploiting public office for personal gains.” The token, which debuted in January 2025, experienced extreme price volatility — soaring to a $13 billion valuation before plummeting by over 82% from its peak. A similar coin associated with First Lady Melania Trump also crashed 93% within weeks. Liccardo argued that the only beneficiaries of these coins were Trump and a select group of insiders, leaving hundreds of thousands of retail investors at a loss. He said: “800,000 people bought this memecoin of Trump’s. And guess what? Almost everyone of those 800,000 people lost a lot of money.” Liccardo described the situation as corruption while\xa0emphasizing the need for legislative action to protect investors from similar schemes in the future. Considering this, the MEME Act is structured to eliminate financial conflicts of interest among public officials by enforcing strict prohibitions and penalties. Despite its bold stance, the MEME Act faces significant legislative hurdles. With Republicans controlling Congress, the bill is unlikely to pass in the current political climate. Even Liccardo reportedly admits that the proposal serves as a symbolic measure for now — a foundation for future action if Democrats regain power. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

2025-02-27 12:54:29,500 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'US Congressman pushes MEME Act to ban officials potentially profiting from memecoins', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/us-congressman-pushes-meme-act-to-ban-officials-potentially-profiting-from-memecoins/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'US Congressman pushes MEME Act to ban officials potentially profiting from memecoins', 'description': 'MEME Act aims to curb corruption by preventing government officials from leveraging political influence in cryptocurrency markets.', 'content': "US Democratic Congressman Sam Liccardo introduced a bill on Feb. 27 to prevent government officials and their families from profiting from cryptocurrencies, including memecoins. The proposed legislation, known as the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, has gained support from multiple Democratic colleagues and is designed to “make corruption criminal again.” If passed, the bill would prohibit elected officials like the president, vice president, members of Congress, and senior executive officials — along with their spouses and dependent children—from issuing, promoting, or financially benefiting from securities, commodities, or cryptocurrencies, including memecoins. The lawmaker also views the bill as an expansion of the Emoluments Clause, which prevents officials from accepting gifts from foreign entities. He argued that profiting from political influence in financial markets should be equally restricted. Additionally, it would penalize violators and require them to forfeit any illicit gains made before the bill’s enactment. Liccardo said he introduced the MEME Act following the controversial launch of TRUMP, a memecoin linked to President Donald Trump. According to him: “The tokens raised a lot concerns among folks about conflict of interest, about exploiting public office for personal gains.” The token, which debuted in January 2025, experienced extreme price volatility — soaring to a $13 billion valuation before plummeting by over 82% from its peak. A similar coin associated with First Lady Melania Trump also crashed 93% within weeks. Liccardo argued that the only beneficiaries of these coins were Trump and a select group of insiders, leaving hundreds of thousands of retail investors at a loss. He said: “800,000 people bought this memecoin of Trump’s. And guess what? Almost everyone of those 800,000 people lost a lot of money.” Liccardo described the situation as corruption while\xa0emphasizing the need for legislative action to protect investors from similar schemes in the future. Considering this, the MEME Act is structured to eliminate financial conflicts of interest among public officials by enforcing strict prohibitions and penalties. Despite its bold stance, the MEME Act faces significant legislative hurdles. With Republicans controlling Congress, the bill is unlikely to pass in the current political climate. Even Liccardo reportedly admits that the proposal serves as a symbolic measure for now — a foundation for future action if Democrats regain power. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

2025-02-27 13:37:37,713 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'SEC agrees to dismiss enforcement case against Consensys', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/sec-agrees-to-dismiss-enforcement-case-against-consensys/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'SEC agrees to dismiss enforcement case against Consensys', 'description': 'The decision comes amid a broad stance shift in the regulator, with multiple enforcement cases dismissed in the past week.', 'content': "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed in principle to dismiss its securities enforcement case against Consensys, according to a Feb. 27 statement. Once final approvals are secured, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court to formally close the case. The resolution follows Consensys’ commitment to contest the allegations. Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin said the dismissal, which is still pending final approvals, concludes the dispute.\xa0He added that the decision to challenge the agency was a broader effort to support blockchain software developers and protect innovation within the crypto industry. Lubin said: “No company wants to be the target of agency enforcement, but at the same time, it was our duty and honor to stand up for blockchain software developers in the hour it was most needed, as I’m sure our industry peers who also stood up against regulatory overreach would tell you.” The Consensys CEO expressed appreciation for the SEC’s shift in approach under its current leadership, which he described as more pro-innovation and pro-investor. He also reaffirmed the firm’s commitment to constructive dialogue with public and private policymakers to ensure balanced regulation supporting consumer protection and industry growth. With the regulatory matter concluded, Consensys plans to focus entirely on development efforts. Lubin indicated that the firm is optimistic about the future of Ethereum and decentralized technologies, emphasizing the acceleration of the shift toward a more decentralized financial system. The SEC filed charges against Consensys on June 28, 2024, alleging that the company engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through its MetaMask Staking service and operated as an unregistered broker via both MetaMask Staking and MetaMask Swaps. According to the complaint, Consensys has facilitated the sale of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking providers Lido and Rocket Pool since at least January 2023. Since Mark Uyeda was nominated as the acting chairman of the SEC and the regulator’s Crypto Task Force was created, high-profile enforcement actions have escalated. On Feb. 21, the SEC reached an agreement with Coinbase to drop its enforcement case, which is also pending final approval from the regulator. The dismissal was followed by a similar decision regarding Robinhood’s crypto unit. In the past week, the SEC also closed its enforcement actions against Uniswap Labs and Gemini, while Tron founder Justin Sun seeks to end the protocol’s litigation with the regulator.

2025-02-27 13:38:04,389 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'SEC agrees to dismiss enforcement case against Consensys', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/sec-agrees-to-dismiss-enforcement-case-against-consensys/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'SEC agrees to dismiss enforcement case against Consensys', 'description': 'The decision comes amid a broad stance shift in the regulator, with multiple enforcement cases dismissed in the past week.', 'content': "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed in principle to dismiss its securities enforcement case against Consensys, according to a Feb. 27 statement. Once final approvals are secured, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court to formally close the case. The resolution follows Consensys’ commitment to contest the allegations. Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin said the dismissal, which is still pending final approvals, concludes the dispute.\xa0He added that the decision to challenge the agency was a broader effort to support blockchain software developers and protect innovation within the crypto industry. Lubin said: “No company wants to be the target of agency enforcement, but at the same time, it was our duty and honor to stand up for blockchain software developers in the hour it was most needed, as I’m sure our industry peers who also stood up against regulatory overreach would tell you.” The Consensys CEO expressed appreciation for the SEC’s shift in approach under its current leadership, which he described as more pro-innovation and pro-investor. He also reaffirmed the firm’s commitment to constructive dialogue with public and private policymakers to ensure balanced regulation supporting consumer protection and industry growth. With the regulatory matter concluded, Consensys plans to focus entirely on development efforts. Lubin indicated that the firm is optimistic about the future of Ethereum and decentralized technologies, emphasizing the acceleration of the shift toward a more decentralized financial system. The SEC filed charges against Consensys on June 28, 2024, alleging that the company engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through its MetaMask Staking service and operated as an unregistered broker via both MetaMask Staking and MetaMask Swaps. According to the complaint, Consensys has facilitated the sale of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking providers Lido and Rocket Pool since at least January 2023. Since Mark Uyeda was nominated as the acting chairman of the SEC and the regulator’s Crypto Task Force was created, high-profile enforcement actions have escalated. On Feb. 21, the SEC reached an agreement with Coinbase to drop its enforcement case, which is also pending final approval from the regulator. The dismissal was followed by a similar decision regarding Robinhood’s crypto unit. In the past week, the SEC also closed its enforcement actions against Uniswap Labs and Gemini, while Tron founder Justin Sun seeks to end the protocol’s litigation with the regulator.

This critical metric is still at risk of crashing further, given the current outlook in the broader crypto market. Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s open interest has crashed over $3 billion since January and currently stands at $1.91 billion. The derivatives volume has also declined by almost 30% and currently stands at $3.71 billion. This development is bearish for DOGE as it indicates a declining interest in its ecosystem among traders. Dogecoin’s open interest is likely to crash further in the meantime, given the bearish sentiment among investors. This bearish sentiment has resulted from the downtrend in the crypto market, which has also led to a massive crash in the Dogecoin price. The foremost meme coin is currently at risk of losing the $0.2 psychological price level, which analysts like Ali Martinez have warned could mark the end of its bull run. Beyond the crash in Dogecoin’s open interest, other metrics paint a bearish picture for Dogecoin and suggest that the decline could continue. In an X post, Martinez revealed that DOGE’s network activity has significantly contracted, with new address creation dropping from 1.29 million in November to just 30,815 today. Similarly, DOGE’s active addresses have dropped from 2.66 million in November last year to around 130,282 today. Meanwhile, DOGE’s whales are choosing to remain on the sidelines amid this downtrend. Their absence could also contribute to a further downtrend, given their usual impact on the meme coin’s price. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggested that the Dogecoin price can still rally to the much-anticipated $1 target despite this market downtrend. In an X post, he revealed that the foremost meme coin is following the same pattern as the 2017 bull run. In line with this, he asserted that DOGE is ready for the next surge. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could rally above $1.7 when this next surge occurs. Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL stated that DOGE will move towards $1.7 when this consolidation phase is complete. He remarked that this move would mirror previous cycles where the meme coin hit the same parallel level of resistance. Meanwhile, the analyst is still convinced that the Dogecoin price could eventually rally to as high as $10 in this market cycle. This is based on a parallel channel which he suggested is mirroring the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles. At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trading at around $0.2, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.'}

2025-02-27 14:21:11,593 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Cybercriminals ditch Bitcoin for stablecoins as illicit trades potentially surpassed $51 billion in 2024 – Chainalysis', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/cybercriminals-ditch-bitcoin-for-stablecoins-as-illicit-trades-potentially-surpassed-51-billion-in-2024-chainalysis/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'Cybercriminals ditch Bitcoin for stablecoins as illicit trades potentially surpassed $51 billion in 2024 – Chainalysis', 'description': 'Chainalysis reports criminals adopt stablecoins and AI to thwart oversight, with illicit activities surging.', 'content': "Illicit crypto transactions exceeded $51 billion in 2024, significantly higher than previous estimates due to underreporting, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The findings, published in the company’s latest Crypto Crime Report, indicate a surge in AI-driven fraud, stablecoin laundering, and sophisticated cybercrime networks. Despite initial projections suggesting a decline in crypto-related crime, deeper analysis revealed that criminals have adapted to regulatory scrutiny, shifting away from Bitcoin (BTC) in favor of stablecoins and privacy-focused assets. The report also highlighted a growing reliance on automated deception and DeFi platforms to obscure illicit transactions. Once the dominant currency in illicit transactions, Bitcoin now accounts for a shrinking share of crypto crime. Chainalysis reported that stablecoins were involved in 63% of illicit crypto transactions last year, marking the third consecutive year they have surpassed Bitcoin in this role. Unlike Bitcoin, which has relatively slower confirmation times and high volatility, stablecoins offer near-instant transactions with minimal price fluctuations. This has made them a preferred tool for laundering large sums through cross-chain bridges, mixers, and decentralized platforms, allowing criminals to rapidly shift funds and evade detection. Major stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, have attempted to crack down on illicit activity by freezing wallets linked to cybercrime. However, criminals have turned to alternatives, including privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, self-custodial wallets, and DeFi-based laundering schemes. The report also noted a 35% drop in ransomware payments year-over-year. While this initially appeared to signal progress in combating cyber extortion, Chainalysis found that ransomware operators had instead diversified their tactics. Following the takedown of the LockBit ransomware group, smaller cybercrime syndicates have filled the gap, and ransomware-as-a-service operations have become more decentralized. Cybercriminals have increasingly focused on data theft and extortion, targeting high-value institutions with threats to leak sensitive information rather than solely demanding ransom payments. Beyond direct financial crimes, Chainalysis found that market manipulation schemes remain a significant problem in the crypto space. DEXs have become hubs for wash trading, where fraudulent traders artificially inflate trading volumes to mislead investors. The report estimated that $2.57 billion in illicit trading volume in 2024 was linked to wash trading and market manipulation. Fraudsters have used automated bots to create the illusion of demand, driving up token prices before executing classic “pump-and-dump” schemes that leave unsuspecting investors with worthless assets.

Chainalysis’ 135-page report also explored the broader trends in crypto crime, including laundering-as-a-service platforms, the decline of darknet markets, and the growing role of AI in financial fraud. The study detailed how North Korean hackers stole a record $1.34 billion last year, highlighting the persistent challenges facing regulators and law enforcement. With stablecoins playing an increasing role in money laundering, regulatory scrutiny is expected to intensify. Meanwhile, the use of AI-powered fraud — including deepfake scams and synthetic identity theft — is expected to expand, making it even more difficult to track illicit financial activity.

2025-02-27 14:21:39,025 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Cybercriminals ditch Bitcoin for stablecoins as illicit trades potentially surpassed $51 billion in 2024 – Chainalysis', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/cybercriminals-ditch-bitcoin-for-stablecoins-as-illicit-trades-potentially-surpassed-51-billion-in-2024-chainalysis/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'Cybercriminals ditch Bitcoin for stablecoins as illicit trades potentially surpassed $51 billion in 2024 – Chainalysis', 'description': 'Chainalysis reports criminals adopt stablecoins and AI to thwart oversight, with illicit activities surging.', 'content': "Illicit crypto transactions exceeded $51 billion in 2024, significantly higher than previous estimates due to underreporting, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The findings, published in the company’s latest Crypto Crime Report, indicate a surge in AI-driven fraud, stablecoin laundering, and sophisticated cybercrime networks. Despite initial projections suggesting a decline in crypto-related crime, deeper analysis revealed that criminals have adapted to regulatory scrutiny, shifting away from Bitcoin (BTC) in favor of stablecoins and privacy-focused assets. The report also highlighted a growing reliance on automated deception and DeFi platforms to obscure illicit transactions. Once the dominant currency in illicit transactions, Bitcoin now accounts for a shrinking share of crypto crime. Chainalysis reported that stablecoins were involved in 63% of illicit crypto transactions last year, marking the third consecutive year they have surpassed Bitcoin in this role. Unlike Bitcoin, which has relatively slower confirmation times and high volatility, stablecoins offer near-instant transactions with minimal price fluctuations. This has made them a preferred tool for laundering large sums through cross-chain bridges, mixers, and decentralized platforms, allowing criminals to rapidly shift funds and evade detection. Major stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, have attempted to crack down on illicit activity by freezing wallets linked to cybercrime. However, criminals have turned to alternatives, including privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, self-custodial wallets, and DeFi-based laundering schemes. The report also noted a 35% drop in ransomware payments year-over-year. While this initially appeared to signal progress in combating cyber extortion, Chainalysis found that ransomware operators had instead diversified their tactics. Following the takedown of the LockBit ransomware group, smaller cybercrime syndicates have filled the gap, and ransomware-as-a-service operations have become more decentralized. Cybercriminals have increasingly focused on data theft and extortion, targeting high-value institutions with threats to leak sensitive information rather than solely demanding ransom payments. Beyond direct financial crimes, Chainalysis found that market manipulation schemes remain a significant problem in the crypto space. DEXs have become hubs for wash trading, where fraudulent traders artificially inflate trading volumes to mislead investors. The report estimated that $2.57 billion in illicit trading volume in 2024 was linked to wash trading and market manipulation. Fraudsters have used automated bots to create the illusion of demand, driving up token prices before executing classic “pump-and-dump” schemes that leave unsuspecting investors with worthless assets. In one high-profile case, crypto firm CLS Global pleaded guilty to wash trading a token that the FBI secretly created as part of a sting operation.

Moreno added that this could potentially result in BTC getting stuck in a lateralization pattern for up to four months. He further highlighted that the current level of traders’ unrealized losses usually signals a local bottom for Bitcoin. Previous occurrences were registered between June and October 2023 and June and October 2024 — if the pattern repeats,\xa0Bitcoin could fail to register decisive price action until June. Based on CryptoSlate data, Bitcoin was trading at $82,900 as of press time, down roughly 0.9% over the past 24 hours. The data highlighted by Moreno comes as Bitcoin holders realized $1.7 billion in losses on Feb. 26, the largest loss realization movement since August 2024. Morena said that despite the traders’ unrealized loss margin suggesting a local bottom, Bitcoin’s metrics are in correction territory. He noted that the MVRV, a commonly used indicator, is below its 365-day moving average. As a result, it can take more time for BTC to find its footing and start a recovery movement. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju shared that it might take one more month to determine whether Bitcoin will revert to a downtrend movement or if a recovery is possible. He added that it all depends on the increase in the buyers’ demand. According to Ju: “Based on the typical two-year cycle, the bull market should last until April 2025 — I mentioned this back in May 2024. The next month or two will be a key turning point for the BTC market. If every indicator confirms a downtrend, I’ll admit I was wrong and post about it.” However, despite the potential for further downside, Ju is not convinced that BTC could drop below $77,000. In his assessment, the worst-case scenario would be Bitcoin consolidating near $77,000 before resuming an upward movement. At the time of press 8:33 pm UTC on Feb. 27, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 0.81% over the past 24 hours.

This move marks a pivotal moment not only for Coinbase but also for the broader crypto market, reflecting a potential shift in regulatory strategy as the SEC aims to engage more transparently with the industry. Acting SEC Chairman Mark T. Uyeda emphasized the importance of this transition in a recent statement, highlighting that the Commission’s previous approach had primarily relied on enforcement actions without meaningful public engagement. “For the last several years, the Commission’s views on crypto have been largely expressed through enforcement actions without engaging the general public,” he remarked. This acknowledgment of past shortcomings signals a commitment to developing a more comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets, spearheaded by the newly formed Crypto Task Force. Announced on January 21, 2025, the Crypto Task Force is designed to facilitate a thoughtful and inclusive dialogue about cryptocurrency regulation. The SEC’s decision to dismiss the case against Coinbase is intended to support the Task Force’s efforts, rather than any specific judgment regarding the merits of the claims involved. Moreover, the SEC’s renewed focus on constructive policy development comes at a time when it has concluded investigations into several prominent crypto companies aside from Coinbase, including Robinhood, Uniswap, Gemini, and ConsenSys. All around, this week of dismissals suggests a broader reevaluation of the SEC’s role in regulating the crypto industry, potentially easing the regulatory burden on firms that have been under scrutiny.

BTC’s price descent has triggered fears of heightened selling pressure in the short term as a significant portion of the asset has been moved into crypto exchanges. Bitcoin’s market dynamics appear to be shifting toward a layout that points to a potential negative outlook for its price. Crypto expert with the nickname “Amr Taha” has reported in a quicktake post that huge amounts of BTC are being transferred to crypto exchanges. In the quicktake research on the CryptoQuant platform, the expert highlighted that over 5,000 BTC was moved on 3 different occasions to the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in a single day. Amr Taha spotted the significant moves after analyzing the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow (Top 10) metric, which tracks the overall BTC deposits into the leading 10 exchanges. This sharp rise in BTC deposits to crypto exchanges implies that holders could be looking to offload their holdings as recent market volatility increases. “A significant increase in exchange inflows can indicate potential selling pressure, as large holders or institutions might be moving BTC to exchanges for liquidation,” Amr Taha stated. As seen in past scenarios, such significant exchange inflows have triggered price corrections, causing uncertainty about Bitcoin’s potential in the short term. The surge in exchange inflows comes prior to the notable sudden drop in BTC’s price due to a downswing in the broader crypto market. Considering the noticeable inflow spikes, it may seem that large BTC holders were preparing to sell their coins before the price correction. Amr Taha noted that the inflows became increasingly volatile as the chart came to a close and Bitcoin’s price fell sharply to the $86,900 level. This could mean that large players are taking profits or panic selling their holdings. With BTC struggling to regain an upward trajectory, persistent inflows into exchanges might delay bullish attempts as this trend often plays a vital role in short-term price movements. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $84,711, demonstrating almost a 6% drop in the past day. Exchange inflows have increased following the release of the United States Consumer Confidence report. Presently, growing worries about inflation and the additional tariffs imposed under the second administration of US President Donald Trump have caused consumer confidence to drop to an 8-month low. Thus far, the president has imposed universal tariffs of 10% and even 60%+ for Chinese goods, possibly resulting in increased customer pricing. With this method, businesses may increase inflation and lower disposable income by passing costs on to customers. Finally, in addition to disrupting supply chains, other nations’ retaliatory tariffs are likely to affect employment in key industries.'}

They are sending fake SMS messages that appear to come from Binance, tricking people into thinking their accounts are at risk. The scam messages tell users that their Binance accounts have been compromised. Some claim unauthorized access from countries like North Korea. The goal is to scare users into taking immediate action without verifying the source. These messages often include a link or phone number for users to contact Binance support. However, these are controlled by scammers. Once users reach out, they are instructed to transfer their funds to a “secure” wallet. In reality, this wallet belongs to the fraudsters, and victims lose their money and sensitive info and end up scratching their heads. Hong Kong-based Web3 expert Joe Zhou, a victim of the scam, shared his experience on Linkedin.\xa0According to Zhou, he received an SMS from his usual Binance number where he always receive verification code. Zhou warns that these scams are getting more sophisticated. He highlights the importance of user education and vigilance in preventing losses. Binance has issued warnings on the fraud. The exchange cautions consumers that it never requests SMS financial transactions or personal information. Users, Binance said, should verify their official Binance accounts or communication channels to double-check communications. To avoid falling for these scams, users should never click on links from unsolicited messages. Instead, users should go directly to Binance’s official website or app. Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) and staying informed about security threats are some of the ways to prevent fraud. Hackers lead people into the trap and force them to make hasty decisions by appealing to their emotions of urgency and fear. In panic mode, users tend to have a cloudy judgment, and fail to verify the legitimacy of a message. As a result, they give out their own personal data, and the phishing scheme succeeds, despite an exchanges’ “improved” safety net. Zhou stated that the mention of “North Korea” caused them to panic, which led them to contact the number provided in the message.

Senate Bill 21 (SB-21), introduced by State Sen. Charles Schwertner, authorizes the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to acquire, manage, and trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lawmakers have argued that holding Bitcoin could protect state financial reserves from inflation and economic instability.\xa0Schwertner originally drafted the bill to focus solely on Bitcoin but revised it in February to include other digital assets. The change followed President Donald Trump’s Jan. 23 executive order directing a federal commission to evaluate the feasibility of a national digital asset reserve. The bill emphasizes Bitcoin’s potential to strengthen Texas’ financial security. It states: “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can serve as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.” Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms, testified in favor of the bill during a Feb. 18 public hearing preceding the committee evaluation. He argued that Bitcoin’s transparent and auditable nature makes it a strong asset for public financial management.\xa0Rochard also warned that Texas must prepare for future economic downturns despite its current strong economy. Texas is among numerous states exploring the creation of Bitcoin reserves. As of February, more than 20 states had introduced proposals to allocate a portion of public funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets. These initiatives aim to diversify state financial holdings and hedge against economic uncertainties. Other states, including Oklahoma, Arizona, and Utah, have introduced similar measures to diversify their financial holdings. Oklahoma lawmakers recently advanced their Bitcoin reserve bill through a House committee, with the legislation slated for a floor vote next. Similarly, Arizona’s Senate Finance Committee approved a bill permitting up to 10% of public funds, including pension systems, to be invested in cryptocurrencies. Utah is also progressing with legislation that would allow the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of public funds to digital assets. However, not all efforts have been successful. States such as Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming have recently rejected similar Bitcoin reserve proposals, citing concerns over the volatility and speculative nature of digital assets.

In a Feb. 27 staff statement, the SEC emphasized that memecoins, which are typically inspired by online trends and lack substantial utility, do not meet the definition of an “investment contract” under the Howey test — a legal standard used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security. The statement highlighted that memecoin transactions do not involve pooled investor funds or managerial efforts from a centralized entity, key factors in determining security status. According to the statement: “Memecoins are primarily purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural engagement, with their value driven by market sentiment rather than the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of others.” The SEC also likened meme coins to collectibles, emphasizing their speculative nature and price volatility. While the SEC’s position relieves memecoin promoters and traders of registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, the agency cautioned that fraudulent activity involving memecoins could still trigger enforcement actions under other federal and state laws. The statement emphasized that labeling a financial product as a “memecoin” does not exempt it from securities regulations if its economic realities indicate otherwise. The clarification comes after years of regulatory scrutiny over digital assets, with the SEC aggressively pursuing enforcement actions against crypto projects deemed to have violated securities laws. However, memecoins, often created as jokes or social experiments, have remained in a legal gray area despite their growing presence in online trading communities. Legal experts view the SEC’s stance as a potential shift in the regulatory landscape, setting a precedent for how speculative digital assets may be treated under federal law. While the statement does not carry legal weight, it signals a departure from previous enforcement patterns that targeted token issuances perceived as securities. The SEC’s announcement could have broad implications for the crypto market, where memecoins have evolved from internet novelties into multi-billion-dollar assets. Despite the statement, uncertainties remain regarding future regulatory developments, particularly as lawmakers and agencies continue to debate comprehensive frameworks for digital assets. The SEC reaffirmed its commitment to evaluating crypto products on a case-by-case basis, warning that new variations of meme coins designed to circumvent securities laws would still be subject to regulatory scrutiny. Investors and crypto enthusiasts welcomed the clarification, viewing it as a step toward regulatory consistency. However, the agency’s warning against fraudulent schemes reinforced the need for market participants to remain cautious amid meme coin speculation.

2025-02-27 20:10:41,148 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Dogecoin Price Gears Up For 75% Rally As Long As It Stays Inside This Channel', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gears-up-a-rally/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Dogecoin Price Gears Up For 75% Rally As Long As It Stays Inside This Channel | Bitcoinist.com', 'description': 'In an X post, crypto analyst Olivier predicted that the Dogecoin price could enjoy a 75% rally as long as it stays within a parallel channel.', 'content': 'Crypto analyst Olivier has provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price amid the market downtrend, which has led to a massive decline for DOGE. The analyst predicts that the foremost meme coin could be gearing up for a 75% rally, which could send its price above $0.3. In an X post, crypto analyst Olivier predicted that the Dogecoin price could enjoy a 75% rally as long as it stays within a parallel channel, which he highlighted on his accompanying chart. Alluding to DOGE’s monthly chart, the analyst asserted that the trend for the foremost meme coin is clear as long as it stays inside the channel. This 75% rally for the Dogecoin price could just be the start, as the analyst assured that the uptrend will resume above $0.3350. His accompanying chart showed that the foremost meme coin could rally to a new all-time high (ATH) and even hit $6 in this market cycle. Based on the chart, DOGE could also reach $30 as it rallies to the upper boundary of this channel. In the meantime, as the analyst suggests, the Dogecoin price needs to hold above the lower boundary of this boundary. The accompanying chart shows that a break below $0.15 could invalidate this bullish setup for DOGE. Given the current downtrend in the broader crypto market, the foremost meme coin is still at risk of dropping to this price level. Crypto analyst David Perk recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could crash further to $0.15. However, the analyst expects DOGE to bounce from that price level, which is still bullish for the meme coin. Staying above $0.15 still puts DOGE within this channel, which could send its price to new ATHs. Meanwhile, amid the market downtrend, crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has reaffirmed that the Dogecoin price could still rally to as high as $10 in this market cycle. The analyst highlighted the price action of the previous two cycles to explain why the meme coin could reach this level and even rally above it. He indicated that the current price action was mirroring that of the previous two cycles and that the Dogecoin price was about to start the second phase of its parabolic rally. DOGECAPITAL expects DOGE to hold around $0.20 on the weekly timeframe. The analyst added that once this consolidatioin is complete, Dogecoin could move towards $1.70. The rally to this level is then expected to pave the way for the third phase of the parabolic move which would send the foremost meme coin to $10 and above. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.2, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.'}

A Thorchain developer known as TCB announced that Pluto, the protocol’s unofficial lead developer, is stepping down. TCB himself has also indicated his imminent departure unless a swift resolution is implemented to prevent illicit flows linked to North Korean actors. TCB’s statement highlighted a long-standing divide between Thorchain’s messaging around decentralization and the reality of its infrastructure. According to the developer, the protocol claims to be censorship-resistant and permissionless, but in reality, a small group of corporate actors control most of the network’s infrastructure and user-facing services. He argued that this contradiction exposes the protocol to regulatory scrutiny and threatens its long-term viability. Thorchain is a permissionless protocol focused on interoperability. However, given its feature of swapping native assets on their respective blockchains, bad actors have leveraged Thorchain’s infrastructure to obscure stolen funds. This is the case following the Bybit hack, which resulted in $1.5 billion lost on Feb. 21. Recently, TCB, Pluto, and another developer known as Oleg Petrov used their power as validators to vote to halt ETH trading on Thorchain to prevent Lazarus Group from laundering money. Thorchain’s design choices have contributed to what TCB describes as an overly centralized network incapable of withstanding regulatory pressure. Unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC), which boast thousands of independent validators, Thorchain relies on a smaller, tightly controlled group of operators.\xa0The network’s requirement for full infrastructure replication across all supported blockchains further complicates validator onboarding, limiting decentralization. Efforts to address these concerns, including proposals for lighter node implementations and an expanded validator set, have been met with resistance. While other protocols, such as Chainflip, have swiftly implemented censorship measures at the network level, Thorchain has yet to adopt similar strategies, which contradicts industry trends. According to TCB, many wallet providers that facilitate the bulk of Thorchain’s non-illicit transaction volume already enforce transaction filtering on their frontends.\xa0If Thorchain continues to allow illicit funds to flow through its network, these providers may sever their integrations, further isolating the protocol from legitimate liquidity sources. TCB warned that the departure of these providers, combined with regulatory scrutiny, could result in a crisis for Thorchain.\xa0With major infrastructure providers and developers now reconsidering their involvement, the protocol faces operational and reputational risks. The concerns raised reflect broader industry tensions between decentralization ideals and the realities of compliance with global anti-money laundering frameworks.\xa0The potential for Thorchain to be implicated in North Korea’s largest-ever crypto theft raises the stakes significantly. TCB asserted that when most transaction flows consist of stolen funds linked to a sanctioned state actor, the issue moves beyond protocol governance and into national security territory. He added that\xa0Thorchain may face enforcement actions that could jeopardize its operations if it is perceived as a conduit for large-scale money laundering.

The hackers—identified as TraderTraitor and the Lazarus Group—allegedly deployed malware through modified cryptocurrency trading applications, allowing them to seize Ethereum and convert it into other cryptocurrencies, according to an FBI statement released on Wednesday. The stolen funds were rapidly transferred to thousands of wallet addresses across multiple blockchains. The FBI suspects these assets will eventually be laundered and converted into fiat currency. While the North Korean government has not acknowledged the theft, reports from South Korea’s intelligence agencies suggest that North Korea has stolen $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency over the past five years. The Washington Post reporting this noted: It represents a rare source of badly needed foreign currency to support its fragile economy and fund its nuclear program in the face of intense U.N. sanctions and North Korea’s strict border closures during the coronavirus pandemic. A UN experts panel separately said it was investigating 58 suspected cyberattacks by North Korea between 2017 to 2023 that saw some $3 billion stolen to “reportedly help to fund the country’s development of weapons of mass destruction.” Bybit’s co-founder and CEO, Ben Zhou, addressed the FBI’s accusations by linking to a site offering bounties to track and freeze the stolen assets. https://t.co/FTHW8gIsT9 https://t.co/SdxPifNHUG — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 27, 2025 The exchange revealed that the attack involved a sophisticated exploit targeting their offline or “cold” wallets, which are generally considered more secure than online storage.

This method involves a fake user interface mimicking the legitimate platform, tricking users into authorizing unauthorized transactions. The repercussions of this breach have extended beyond Bybit’s ecosystem, triggering a decline in overall cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin has so far faced significant plunge falling to as low as $82,000 levels on Wednesday. Industry observers suggest that this incident will increase regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges and their security measures. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView'}

2025-02-27 23:05:10,618 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Pakistan Plans New Council for Crypto Regulation: Report', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/pakistan-plans-new-council-for-crypto-regulation-report/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Pakistan Plans New Council for Crypto Regulation: Report | Bitcoinist.com', 'description': 'According to a recent report by Dawn, Pakistan is set to establish a National Crypto Council to oversee digital asset regulation in the country.', 'content': 'According to a recent report by Dawn, Pakistan is set to establish a National Crypto Council to oversee digital asset regulation in the country. This decision marks a significant policy shift as Pakistan moves toward embracing cryptocurrencies, a stance that contrasts with its previous resistance. Since US President Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 election, countries around the world have been steadily adopting a more favorable attitude toward digital assets. Trump’s campaign had strongly advocated for crypto-friendly regulations, and his administration has followed through with policies supporting digital assets. Against this backdrop, Pakistan has emerged as one of the latest major countries to publicly announce a complete turnaround in its approach to digital assets. In a landmark decision, the South Asian nation legalized cryptocurrencies in November 2024, signalling a departure from its long-standing resistance to digital assets. Now, in a further step toward regulating the industry, Pakistan is planning to create a National Crypto Council that will focus on developing legislation for the rapidly growing digital asset sector. This initiative follows a recent meeting between Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and a delegation of US officials, including Trump’s newly appointed digital asset advisors. The proposed council will consist of government representatives, regulatory authorities, and industry experts. The report reads in part: This crypto council will oversee policy development, address regulatory challenges, and ensure that Pakistan’s digital asset ecosystem evolves in a secure, compliant, and sustainable manner. The council will also collaborate with friendly countries to develop standardised frameworks for international digital economic engagement. It is worth noting that as recently as last year, both the Pakistani government and its central bank maintained a strict stance against digital assets. A former finance minister had even declared that digital assets would never be legalized in the country. However, the government’s latest policy shift indicates a complete reversal of this position. Finance Minister Aurangzeb’s progressive stance on digital assets suggests that Pakistan is now committed to establishing a well-regulated and positive framework for the digital assets industry. The move aligns with international best practices and complies with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines, which aim to prevent financial crimes and money laundering. Aurangzeb has also emphasized the importance of blockchain technology in modernizing Pakistan’s financial sector. He has directed relevant stakeholders to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework that ensures security, transparency, compliance with global regulatory standards, and economic viability while safeguarding against illicit financial activities. The Pakistani Finance Minister’s remarks suggest that Pakistan is not just looking to legalize digital assets, but also intends to integrate blockchain technology into its financial infrastructure to promote efficiency and innovation. Digital asset regulations in Asia differ significantly depending on the country. For instance, unlike Pakistan, India continues to maintain a harsh stance on digital assets, imposing high taxes on crypto transactions to discourage people from engaging with the industry. India’s stance on cryptocurrencies is interesting given the fact that the country leads the world in terms of crypto adoption. Neighbouring country Bhutan surprised the world last year when it revealed its massive Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. Moving east, Singapore and Taiwan have emerged as two of the most pro-crypto nations in the world. Conversely, China continues to make crypto trading harder for its residents. Further east, South Korea and Japan appear to be following a cautious approach toward cryptocurrencies. At press time, BTC trades at $85,147, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours.'}

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju calls it a "noob" mistake, citing typical bull market corrections.', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading below key demand levels after losing the $90K mark earlier this week. The price has tagged fresh lows, and bulls have lost control as the market faces intense selling pressure. BTC has dropped 14% in less than three days, entering a panic selling phase as investors react to market uncertainty. The sudden drop has sparked fear and speculation, with some analysts calling for a bear market while others remain optimistic about BTC’s long-term outlook. Despite this sharp correction, some crypto experts argue that panic selling at this stage is a rookie mistake. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shared key metrics on X displaying BTC’s price drawdown after price discovery, pointing out that these types of corrections are historically normal in bull markets. According to Ju, if you’re panic selling now, you’re probably a noob—implying that this is a typical shakeout designed to flush out weak hands before the next rally. With Bitcoin’s price struggling below $90K, the next few days will be crucial to determine whether BTC stabilizes and recovers or continues to break lower toward deeper demand levels. Bitcoin has faced its biggest correction of the year, with the price struggling below the $90K level as investor fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The sudden drop has shaken confidence, and speculation about a potential bear market is rising as BTC sets new lows. Despite the sharp decline, top analysts are still watching for key confirmation levels. The market is at a critical point, where BTC could either consolidate below $90K for an extended period or see a strong push above $95K to confirm a recovery rally. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes or faces further downside pressure. Ki Young Ju’s key insights about the correction explain that a 30% pullback in a Bitcoin bull cycle is common. He reminds investors that in 2021, BTC dropped 53% during its bull market yet still recovered to reach a new all-time high. Ju warns against emotional trading, stating that buying when prices rise and selling when they fall is the worst investment strategy. Ju emphasizes that investors should have a clear plan rather than reacting impulsively. While the recent price action looks scary, historical trends suggest that this type of correction is normal in a long-term Bitcoin bull run. Bitcoin is currently trading at $86,400, hovering just above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 5% away from the 200-day Moving Average (MA). These key indicators serve as long-term support levels, and holding above them is crucial for bulls to prevent further downside. If BTC stabilizes at these levels, the next major step in reclaiming bullish momentum would be pushing above the $90K level. However, the market remains highly volatile, and this process could take time before the next major rally takes off. Investors are closely monitoring price action to see if Bitcoin can sustain a recovery phase or if another wave of selling pressure will push it into lower demand zones. Historically, when Bitcoin tests the 200-day MA, it often leads to a period of consolidation before a significant move. If bulls manage to reclaim the $90K mark and hold it as support, this would signal a potential uptrend resumption. However, failure to hold current levels could result in further declines, with $82K–$84K as the next key demand zone. For now, traders are waiting to see whether Bitcoin can defend its current levels or if a longer consolidation phase is needed before a breakout occurs.

2025-02-28 02:10:35,579 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin’s $2.16 Billion Capitulation: Who Sold At The Biggest Loss?', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-2-16-billion-capitulation-biggest-loss/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Bitcoin’s $2.16 Billion Selloff: Who Sold At Biggest Loss?', 'description': 'The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has broken down which Bitcoin investor cohorts sold at the biggest loss during the latest price crash.', 'content': 'The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has broken down which Bitcoin investor cohorts sold at the biggest loss during the latest price crash. In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed what the capitulation event triggered by the Bitcoin price crash has been like. The indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Loss,” which measures the total amount of loss that the investors as a whole are ‘realizing’ through their transactions. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold on the network to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous value for any coin was more than the price at which it’s being sold now, then the token’s sale could be assumed to be leading to loss realization. The Realized Loss adds up the difference between the two prices for all such tokens to calculate the total for the network. Another metric known as the Realized Profit keeps track of the coins of the opposite type. Generally, any sudden drop in the BTC price throws the investors into a panic and some loss-taking tends to occur, especially from the recent buyers, who don’t tend to be too resolute. The latest crash has been no exception to this. “Between Feb 25-27, over $2.16B in realized losses came from the most recent market entrants,” notes the analytics firm. Below is the chart posted by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Loss for the various BTC investor cohorts over the past month. As is visible in the above graph, the older BTC cohorts have hardly participated in any loss-taking recently. This makes sense, as even after the crash, BTC is trading at higher prices than it was a few months ago, so those who have been holding for a long time would still be above water. Out of the younger groups who have indeed sold at large losses, the numbers look like this: $322 million for 24 hours, $927 million for 1 day to 1 week, $678 million for 1 week to 1 month, and $257 million for 1 month to 3 months. The cohort that stands out among these is the 1 day to 1 week one, which made up for more than 42% of the capitulation event. Thus, it would appear that the buyers who just got in within the past week ended up dumping the hardest. As for how the latest selloff compares historically, here is a wider view of the Realized Loss chart: At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,200, down almost 12% in the past week.'}

2025-02-28 03:37:49,071 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index At Lowest Since 2022 Bear: Time To Be Greedy?', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-fear-greed-index-lowest-2022-bear-greedy/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': "Bitcoin Extreme Fear Most Since '22 Bear: Time To Be Greedy?", 'description': 'Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has sunk to its lowest level since the 2022 bear market following the latest crash in the BTC price.', 'content': 'Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has sunk to its lowest level since the 2022 bear market following the latest crash in the BTC price. The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative\xa0that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred for representing the market mentality. There are five zones that this value can be in: extreme fear (25 and under), fear (26 to 46), neutral (47 to 53), greed (54 to 75), and extreme greed (76 and over). Here is how the Fear & Greed Index appears right now: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is sitting at 10 right now, which means the sentiment is deep into the extreme fear territory. Just a few days ago, the mood among the traders was significantly different, as the index was inside the neutral zone instead. The reason behind this drastic change in the sentiment is the crash that the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through over the last few days. Following the latest decline in the Fear & Greed Index, its value has hit the lowest point since mid-2022, when Bitcoin was deep into its last bear market. Thus, it would appear the bull run tumbling over in this manner has dealt quite the blow to investor morale. If history is anything to refer to, though, this may not actually be such a bad development for the cryptocurrency. Indeed, BTC has often formed a bottom when the sentiment has dropped into extreme fear. A similar effect has also been witnessed for the extreme greed side, where the coin has generally tended to attain a top. Last month’s peak also occurred when the index was inside this region. Thus, it appears that Bitcoin has a tendency to move in the direction that’s opposite to what the majority of the crowd is expecting. Followers of a trading technique called contrarian investing exploit this fact to time their moves. These traders buy when the average investor is feeling dread and sell when a wave of euphoria is pulsing through the market. Warren Buffet‘s famous quote also sums up this idea, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” With the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index falling to an extremely low level, perhaps contrarian traders would now be considering buying into the asset. It only remains to be seen, though, whether BTC would be able to form a bottom at these values, or if sentiment would have to degrade even further before it happens. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $84,700, down almost 14% in the last seven days.'}

2025-02-28 03:38:15,524 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index At Lowest Since 2022 Bear: Time To Be Greedy?', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-fear-greed-index-lowest-2022-bear-greedy/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': "Bitcoin Extreme Fear Most Since '22 Bear: Time To Be Greedy?", 'description': 'Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has sunk to its lowest level since the 2022 bear market following the latest crash in the BTC price.', 'content': 'Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has sunk to its lowest level since the 2022 bear market following the latest crash in the BTC price. The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative\xa0that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred for representing the market mentality. There are five zones that this value can be in: extreme fear (25 and under), fear (26 to 46), neutral (47 to 53), greed (54 to 75), and extreme greed (76 and over). Here is how the Fear & Greed Index appears right now: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is sitting at 10 right now, which means the sentiment is deep into the extreme fear territory. Just a few days ago, the mood among the traders was significantly different, as the index was inside the neutral zone instead. The reason behind this drastic change in the sentiment is the crash that the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through over the last few days. Following the latest decline in the Fear & Greed Index, its value has hit the lowest point since mid-2022, when Bitcoin was deep into its last bear market. Thus, it would appear the bull run tumbling over in this manner has dealt quite the blow to investor morale. If history is anything to refer to, though, this may not actually be such a bad development for the cryptocurrency. Indeed, BTC has often formed a bottom when the sentiment has dropped into extreme fear. A similar effect has also been witnessed for the extreme greed side, where the coin has generally tended to attain a top. Last month’s peak also occurred when the index was inside this region. Thus, it appears that Bitcoin has a tendency to move in the direction that’s opposite to what the majority of the crowd is expecting. Followers of a trading technique called contrarian investing exploit this fact to time their moves. These traders buy when the average investor is feeling dread and sell when a wave of euphoria is pulsing through the market. Warren Buffet‘s famous quote also sums up this idea, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” With the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index falling to an extremely low level, perhaps contrarian traders would now be considering buying into the asset. It only remains to be seen, though, whether BTC would be able to form a bottom at these values, or if sentiment would have to degrade even further before it happens. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $84,700, down almost 14% in the last seven days.'}

2025-02-28 04:43:22,053 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin dip below $80k and crypto market turmoil as $1 trillion in unrealized profit vanishes', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-dip-below-80k-and-crypto-market-in-turmoil-as-1-trillion-in-unrealized-profit-vanishes/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'Bitcoin dip below $80k and crypto market turmoil as $1 trillion in unrealized profit vanishes', 'description': 'Growing investor unease as Bitcoin and leading altcoins suffer sharp losses amid plummeting confidence that has led to over $1 trillion loss.', 'content': 'Bitcoin has plunged below $80,000, marking its lowest point since November 2024, as the broader crypto market experiences a significant downturn. The ongoing sell-off has erased nearly all gains recorded after Donald Trump’s election victory, signaling a period of intense volatility. Data from CryptoSlate shows that Bitcoin fell by more than 8% in the last 24 hours, briefly touching $78,790 before recovering to $79,200. Over the past week, the leading digital asset has lost 20%, dropping from over $100,000 to current levels. With this performance, Bitcoin price has now returned to levels last seen after Trump’s election victory in November 2024. Meanwhile, the decline isn’t limited to Bitcoin. Leading altcoins have also suffered sharp losses. Ethereum has plunged nearly 50% from its post-election peak in late 2024, while BNB, Solana,\xa0XRP,\xa0Dogecoin, and Cardano have shed up to 10% in the last 24 hours. As a result, the market-wide unrealized losses have surpassed $1 trillion in the past month, reflecting growing investor unease. This volatility has triggered widespread liquidations. CoinGlass data reveals that over $918 million of leveraged positions have been wiped out, impacting more than 225,000 traders. Most of these losses hit long traders betting on price increases, with $810 million liquidated. Expecting a further decline, short traders also saw $108 million erased. However, despite this bloodbath, crypto enthusiasts have argued that these corrections are typical for the market. Marc van der Chijs, the co-founder of Bitcoin miner Hut8, wrote on X: “Markets are extremely nervous, but zoom out and you’ll see that nothing has changed. 30% drops happen a few times every bull market, normally followed by a huge price explosion.” Market analysts attribute the ongoing downturn to a combination of factors, including uncertainty over Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened investor confidence, and a substantial $3 billion outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs. According to The Kobeissi Letter, fears of a trade war have significantly impacted risk assets, wiping out $800 billion from the crypto market since Jan. 20. The firm noted that during such trade war periods, liquidity often shifts toward the US dollar, which is perceived as a more stable asset during economic uncertainty. It added that\xa0the crypto market is now ten times larger than previous trade conflicts,\xa0amplifying\xa0the price fluctuations. The Kobeissi Letter explained: “The perceived loss of STABILITY during trade wars worries retail. As a result, we see massive daily outflows as the ‘herd’ moves together…This is why BTC can fall $5,000+ in minutes.” Additionally, investor sentiment remains weak, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeting to 21 and pushing towards “extreme fear” levels. This is its weakest reading since the 2022 bear market, which was triggered by the collapse of several crypto firms, including FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and others.

Data from CryptoSlate shows that Bitcoin fell by more than 8% in the last 24 hours, briefly touching $78,790 before recovering to $79,200. Over the past week, the leading digital asset has lost 20%, dropping from over $100,000 to current levels. With this performance, Bitcoin price has now returned to levels last seen after Trump’s election victory in November 2024. Meanwhile, the decline isn’t limited to Bitcoin. Leading altcoins have also suffered sharp losses. Ethereum has plunged nearly 50% from its post-election peak in late 2024, while BNB, Solana,\xa0XRP,\xa0Dogecoin, and Cardano have shed up to 10% in the last 24 hours. As a result, the market-wide unrealized losses have surpassed $1 trillion in the past month, reflecting growing investor unease. This volatility has triggered widespread liquidations. CoinGlass data reveals that over $918 million of leveraged positions have been wiped out, impacting more than 225,000 traders. Most of these losses hit long traders betting on price increases, with $810 million liquidated. Expecting a further decline, short traders also saw $108 million erased. However, despite this bloodbath, crypto enthusiasts have argued that these corrections are typical for the market. Marc van der Chijs, the co-founder of Bitcoin miner Hut8, wrote on X: “Markets are extremely nervous, but zoom out and you’ll see that nothing has changed. 30% drops happen a few times every bull market, normally followed by a huge price explosion.” Market analysts attribute the ongoing downturn to a combination of factors, including uncertainty over Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened investor confidence, and a substantial $3 billion outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs. According to The Kobeissi Letter, fears of a trade war have significantly impacted risk assets, wiping out $800 billion from the crypto market since Jan. 20. The firm noted that during such trade war periods, liquidity often shifts toward the US dollar, which is perceived as a more stable asset during economic uncertainty. It added that\xa0the crypto market is now ten times larger than previous trade conflicts,\xa0amplifying\xa0the price fluctuations. The Kobeissi Letter explained: “The perceived loss of STABILITY during trade wars worries retail. As a result, we see massive daily outflows as the ‘herd’ moves together…This is why BTC can fall $5,000+ in minutes.” Additionally, investor sentiment remains weak, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeting to 21 and pushing towards “extreme fear” levels. This is its weakest reading since the 2022 bear market, which was triggered by the collapse of several crypto firms, including FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and others.

2025-02-28 06:21:37,279 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Coinbase-backed Base unveils upgrades to beat Solana performance by double', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-backed-base-unveils-upgrades-to-beat-solana-performance-by-double/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'Coinbase-backed Base unveils upgrades to beat Solana performance by double', 'description': 'Coinbase-backed Ethereum layer-2 network Base has introduced a trio of innovations designed to elevate the blockchain.', 'content': 'Coinbase-backed Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, has introduced three key innovations to improve blockchain scalability and usability. According to a Feb. 27 blog post, these tools—Flashblocks, Smart Wallet Sub Accounts, and Base Appchains—seek to simplify blockchain development while enhancing transaction efficiency. Base explained that these tools highlight its focus on expanding the on-chain economy through faster transactions, customized infrastructure, and improved wallet functionality. It stated: “We’re introducing three new building blocks to empower everyone to build onchain: Flashblocks to make Base faster, Base Appchains to help Base scale, and Smart Wallet Sub Accounts to make Base simpler to use.” These updates reinforce Base’s position as the leading Ethereum Layer 2 network. Data from GrowThePie shows that it handles 4.61 million weekly active addresses, which accounts for over 50% of Layer 2 activity. According to the post, Base is testing Flashblocks, a new technology designed to cut transaction processing time from two seconds to 200 milliseconds. Developed by Flashbots, this innovation could make Base ten times faster, potentially establishing it as the most efficient Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain. Flashblocks leverages preconfirmation blocks that refresh every 200 milliseconds, enabling rapid transaction finality. Base added: “This architecture draws inspiration from innovations in block propagation and execution — such as Solana’s shreds and Celestia’s data squares — while introducing novel optimizations for the rollup context.” Jesse Pollak, Base’s lead developer, emphasized its performance potential, noting that the platform could operate twice as fast as Solana, significantly improving both developer and user experience. The technology is currently being tested on Base’s Sepolia testnet. A mainnet launch is planned for Q2 2024. Base is rolling out Base Appchains, a Layer 3 (L3) scaling solution built on the OP Stack. This tool is designed to support applications requiring high transaction throughput. Base stated that Appchains offer developers a more flexible environment by enabling configurable gas tokens, fee structures, and permission models. The solution integrates directly with the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) and provides enterprise-grade infrastructure, including managed sequencers and dedicated blockspace. Several applications, including Horizen, Metacade, and others, are already leveraging Base Appchains to support real-world privacy applications and meet the high demands of on-chain gamers. Smart Wallet Sub Accounts improve how users manage their on-chain activity by allowing multiple wallets to function within a single interface. This feature reduces unnecessary wallet pop-ups and enhances transaction security through granular spending limits. It also simplifies onboarding, as new accounts can be funded directly from a primary wallet while maintaining strict access controls. According to Base, Smart Wallet Sub Accounts are\xa0ready for integration on the network’s testnet and will be live on the mainnet in Q2. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin\'s potential.

2025-02-28 06:22:04,424 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Coinbase-backed Base unveils upgrades to beat Solana performance by double', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-backed-base-unveils-upgrades-to-beat-solana-performance-by-double/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'Coinbase-backed Base unveils upgrades to beat Solana performance by double', 'description': 'Coinbase-backed Ethereum layer-2 network Base has introduced a trio of innovations designed to elevate the blockchain.', 'content': 'Coinbase-backed Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, has introduced three key innovations to improve blockchain scalability and usability. According to a Feb. 27 blog post, these tools—Flashblocks, Smart Wallet Sub Accounts, and Base Appchains—seek to simplify blockchain development while enhancing transaction efficiency. Base explained that these tools highlight its focus on expanding the on-chain economy through faster transactions, customized infrastructure, and improved wallet functionality. It stated: “We’re introducing three new building blocks to empower everyone to build onchain: Flashblocks to make Base faster, Base Appchains to help Base scale, and Smart Wallet Sub Accounts to make Base simpler to use.” These updates reinforce Base’s position as the leading Ethereum Layer 2 network. Data from GrowThePie shows that it handles 4.61 million weekly active addresses, which accounts for over 50% of Layer 2 activity. According to the post, Base is testing Flashblocks, a new technology designed to cut transaction processing time from two seconds to 200 milliseconds. Developed by Flashbots, this innovation could make Base ten times faster, potentially establishing it as the most efficient Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain. Flashblocks leverages preconfirmation blocks that refresh every 200 milliseconds, enabling rapid transaction finality. Base added: “This architecture draws inspiration from innovations in block propagation and execution — such as Solana’s shreds and Celestia’s data squares — while introducing novel optimizations for the rollup context.” Jesse Pollak, Base’s lead developer, emphasized its performance potential, noting that the platform could operate twice as fast as Solana, significantly improving both developer and user experience. The technology is currently being tested on Base’s Sepolia testnet. A mainnet launch is planned for Q2 2024. Base is rolling out Base Appchains, a Layer 3 (L3) scaling solution built on the OP Stack. This tool is designed to support applications requiring high transaction throughput. Base stated that Appchains offer developers a more flexible environment by enabling configurable gas tokens, fee structures, and permission models. The solution integrates directly with the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) and provides enterprise-grade infrastructure, including managed sequencers and dedicated blockspace. Several applications, including Horizen, Metacade, and others, are already leveraging Base Appchains to support real-world privacy applications and meet the high demands of on-chain gamers. Smart Wallet Sub Accounts improve how users manage their on-chain activity by allowing multiple wallets to function within a single interface. This feature reduces unnecessary wallet pop-ups and enhances transaction security through granular spending limits. It also simplifies onboarding, as new accounts can be funded directly from a primary wallet while maintaining strict access controls. According to Base, Smart Wallet Sub Accounts are\xa0ready for integration on the network’s testnet and will be live on the mainnet in Q2. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin\'s potential.

These include legislative appropriations, investment earnings, dedicated revenue, and private donations. A newly established advisory committee would help guide investment decisions. Additionally, the bill requires biennial reports to ensure transparency and track the reserve’s performance. The price of Bitcoin is going up and down a lot right now, but this proposal is still moving forward. Bitcoin is worth $79,500 as of February 28, 2025, which is $8,3% less than when it was last closed. The most it went up that day was $86,970, and the least it went down was $79,105. The way the price has changed shows both the pros and cons of trading or just “hodling” bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price has gone up and down in the past, and some people say that Texas could become financially unstable if it owns such an unstable commodity. Some people, though, think that Bitcoin could be a way to protect against inflation and a weakened dollar. Not only is Texas among the states investigating cryptocurrency investments. Similar proposals by Oklahoma, Arizona, and Utah explore the concept of including digital assets into their financial reserves. Texas seems to be leading the charge even though none of these states have yet passed such legislation. Should SB-21 be enacted, it might establish standards for other states. The result might affect the governments’ future sentiment toward cryptocurrencies and maybe include them into their public financial systems. Proponents of the measure contend that Texas would find Bitcoin appealing as its distributed character is unique. They see it as a means to establish the Lone Star state as a leader in digital asset adoption and therefore boost the state’s financial independence. On the other side, detractors of Bitcoin caution on its erratic price swings. They claim that should the reserve lose value, taxpayers could find themselves burdened. These issues have attracted attention as legislators discuss the plan considering the recent price drop of Bitcoin. For now, the bill moves to the next stage, with Texas watching closely to see if the state will officially add Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

On the other side, detractors of Bitcoin caution on its erratic price swings. They claim that should the reserve lose value, taxpayers could find themselves burdened. These issues have attracted attention as legislators discuss the plan considering the recent price drop of Bitcoin. For now, the bill moves to the next stage, with Texas watching closely to see if the state will officially add Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

2025-02-28 07:06:09,456 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'El Salvador to focus on open-source AI development with new laws to foster innovation', 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/el-salvador-to-focus-on-open-source-ai-development-with-new-laws-to-foster-innovation/', 'source': 'cryptoslate.com', 'title': 'El Salvador to focus on open-source AI development with new laws to foster innovation', 'description': 'Nayib Bukele-led El Salvador government sets global precedent by prioritizing open-source artificial intelligence (AI) development.', 'content': 'El Salvador has introduced a new artificial intelligence (AI) law to foster innovation while ensuring responsible development and regulatory oversight. On Feb. 28, the country’s National Bitcoin Office confirmed the legislation’s approval, highlighting its role in integrating AI into key sectors while maintaining data security and ethical standards. This new legal framework establishes clear guidelines for AI research and application, making it the first national law to prioritize open-source AI development. It builds on existing regulations, such as the Personal Data Protection Act and the Cybersecurity and Information Security Act, to create a structured environment for AI advancement. However, the AI law specifies that in the event of any conflict, the AI Law will take precedence over the Personal Data Protection Law. In other words, while the AI law works alongside data protection legislation, it will override the Data Protection Act where necessary to facilitate AI development. The Nayib Bukele-led government sees this initiative as a strategic step toward attracting investment and technological growth. The country’s lawmakers believe that by embracing AI, the government can unlock new economic opportunities, particularly for young professionals eager to contribute to the evolving digital landscape. The law provides legal certainty for AI developers, ensuring protection from early-stage experimentation to full-scale implementation. It also introduces safeguards against the misuse of AI technologies while addressing proprietary and open-source models. A key focus of the legislation is promoting AI research by establishing dedicated laboratories and innovation centers. These institutions will explore AI-driven solutions for public services, including traffic management, water resource monitoring, and geothermal energy optimization. The goal is to enhance the country’s infrastructure and improve the quality of life for its citizens. Additionally, the framework prioritizes education and workforce training by equipping institutions with state-of-the-art AI resources. This initiative aims to build a strong domestic AI talent pool, positioning El Salvador as an AI research and development hub. Meanwhile, the law mandates the creation of the National Agency for Artificial Intelligence (ANIA) to ensure compliance with ethical standards. This agency will oversee AI regulation and enforce guidelines to prevent misuse. ANIA will also manage the National Registry of Artificial Intelligence Development, a system designed to track AI developers and ensure transparency in the sector.

Let's see what they're all about.", 'content': 'Rumor has it that Chat-GPT is developing a new OpenAI model – Chat-GPT 4.5 – that could be 20x more expensive than the original version. And such news is casting a light on the best AI tokens anticipated to jump 100x. And that’s not all OpenAI is working on. Its video generation model Sora is getting set to launch for plus and pro users across the UK and EU regions. Such breakthroughs are fantastic news for the AI sector. OpenAI is finally waging a grand battle against DeepSeek. The only issue with such developments is that Chat-GPT 4.5’s cost could be sky-high. The funds are likely needed to help it advance or out-price smaller competitors in order to make a killing. But worry not: there are cheaper entry points into the AI realm, ones of which also utilize blockchain technology. Just look at $MIND, $MASA, and $NUM, for instance – they’re flying high and have what it takes to jump 100x by this year’s end. $MIND is one of the best presales of 2025. It’s the foundation of the MIND of Pepe ecosystem, which is developing a novel AI agent that’s merging meme coin culture with groundbreaking machine learning tech. Once it goes live, it will scour crypto X (Twitter), dApps, and discuss with influencers to gather pressing industry information. The AI agent is also self-evolving, which means that spurs market discussions the more it connects with the online Web3 world. But there’s a catch: only token holders can attain its exclusive trading insights. And the more it interacts across the board, the greater the token’s price will likely rocket. The token was initially valued at $0.00310100 when going live on presale on January 13. It has climbed by over 10% to $0.0034128 since, and there are no signs of its price slowing down anytime soon. So, there’s simply no better time to buy $MIND at its current lowest price. Considering that its price is anticipated to hit $0.00535 by this year’s end, now signals a great time to get involved. $MASA is another pioneering AI token worth checking out, having jumped by nearly 23% since yesterday. In a nutshell, it’s on a mission to create a thriving platform where its users can own, share, and earn from their data – a particularly useful use case in the age of AI, where such data is essential for powering and training machine learning algorithms. To encourage users to hand over their data to help build AI applications, they receive $MASA tokens as rewards. $MASA can also be paid to access the AI services on the Masa network, can be staked for passive income, and enables users to participate in governance so they have a say on the ecosystem’s future trajectory. Plus, security-conscious investors can rest easy knowing that the Masa network integrates with technologies such as the Zero-Knowledge Soulbound Tokens (zkSBTs) to boost its privacy. It also has a second subnet on Bittensor, which helps fine-tune Masa Network’s large AI algorithms. You can buy $MASA on major exchanges, including Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, and KuCoin, for just $0.038 – an extremely cost-friendly access point into the thriving AI industry, which is currently valued at around $243B and is predicted to race past $826B by 2030. Another cutting-edge AI coin making waves is $NUM. Since yesterday, its trading volume has surged by around 24%, owing to its role as the linchpin of Numbers Protocol. Numbers Protocol is a fully decentralized ecosystem that provides content verification for AI-powered businesses and tools. It builds trust in the media and art industries by verifying the origins and authenticity of digital content. Considering that thousands, if not millions, of unlicensed images are stolen every day, amounting to $60B worth of damages daily, its utility has never been more pressing. $NUM is used to pay for the network’s services, including marketplace listings and asset enrollment. This gives the token actual utility in the ecosystem, which should build a strong foundation for future price hikes. The token is also distributed as a reward to network participants, incentivizing users to create and verify trustworthy content at the highest standards. It can also be staked to earn more $NUM. You can contribute to an authentic AI world by purchasing $NUM on exchange giants like MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate.io for around $0.034. While OpenAI’s innovations are notable advancements that should not be ignored, Chat-GPT 4.5’s possibly hefty price tag could hinder widespread adoption by everyday AI enthusiasts.

2025-02-28 08:00:44,707 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin Supply In Profit Drops During Price Correction – 4.4 Million Bitcoin Now Held At A Loss', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-in-profit-drops-during-price-correction-4-4-million-bitcoin-now-held-at-a-loss/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Bitcoin Supply In Profit Drops During Price Correction – 4.4 Million Bitcoin Now Held At A Loss | Bitcoinist.com', 'description': 'Bitcoin (BTC) plunges below $80K, 4.4M BTC now at a loss. Is this a bull market end or correction? CryptoQuant data shows extreme fear.', 'content': 'Bitcoin has plunged below the $80K level, setting fresh lows and sparking fear across the market. The recent downturn has erased over 18% of BTC’s value since last Sunday, leaving investor sentiment at extremely fearful levels. This sell-off has led to concerns about whether the bull market is coming to an end or if this is just another major correction within a long-term uptrend. According to CryptoQuant insights, a staggering 4.4 million BTC from the total supply have now moved into a loss. This metric reflects the number of coins that were bought and are now worth less than their purchase price, primarily from traders who entered the market around the $95K level. Historically, these phases have led to either panic-driven capitulation or strong bounce-backs, depending on market reaction in the coming days. As Bitcoin hovers near fresh lows, all eyes are on whether bulls can reclaim key levels or if further declines will follow. With sentiment at extreme fear, the next few trading sessions could be crucial in determining if Bitcoin is in for a prolonged correction or setting up for a rebound. Bitcoin has experienced a major correction, plunging to its lowest level since early November 2024. This unexpected drop has shaken the bullish outlook that many investors had for BTC and altcoins, casting doubt on the potential for massive returns in 2025. The sharp decline has led to increased fear across the market, with investors growing anxious about a possible shift into a bear market. The market is now in extreme fear, as further selling pressure could drive BTC to even lower levels. With sentiment at its lowest point in months, traders are watching closely to see if Bitcoin can stabilize or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. Historically, major sell-offs have been followed by either strong bounces or extended consolidation phases, making the next few trading sessions crucial. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights on X, revealing that currently, 4.4 million BTC from the total supply have moved into a loss. This metric represents the number of coins bought and sold around the $95K level, reflecting how many traders are now holding BTC at a loss. Additionally, the supply in profit has dropped from 19.7 million BTC to 15.3 million BTC, indicating that a significant portion of holders are underwater. With Bitcoin now trading below key support levels, the market must decide whether this correction marks the start of a bearish phase or is just another pullback before a rebound. If BTC fails to hold its current levels, a further drop could be imminent, but if bulls regain control, this could be a strong buying opportunity for long-term investors. Bitcoin is trading at $80,190 after experiencing days of relentless selling pressure and rising fear that a new bear market could be unfolding. The cryptocurrency has lost over 18% of its value since last Sunday, shaking investor confidence and bringing BTC to its lowest level since early November 2024. Bulls now face a critical challenge as they must defend the $80K mark and push BTC back above $85,500 as soon as possible. This level is crucial because it aligns with both the 200-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA)—two key indicators of long-term trend strength. Failing to reclaim these levels could signal further downside pressure, making a bearish continuation more likely. If BTC fails to react positively at current levels, the next key support zone sits around $75K. Losing this level could trigger even more panic selling, further confirming a bearish shift in market structure. On the other hand, a quick recovery above $85,500 could restore confidence, setting the stage for a potential bounce toward $90K in the coming weeks. The next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView'}

On Feb. 28, Buterin shared his concerns on X, pointing out that a lot of lost crypto stems from users being locked out of their wallets rather than theft. Buterin said: “There’s also plenty of people who have lost huge amounts of crypto to *loss* rather than theft. Software bug, forgotten password, lost device, paper wallet burned down in LA fire, upgraded device without backing up data …. lots of ways for that to happen.” He also highlighted a key challenge in that investors who lose access to their funds often have no one to hold accountable. He believes many choose to remain silent out of embarrassment, further complicating the issue. Buterin’s comment draws further attention to a significant risk of self-custody in the potential for permanent asset loss. Although self-custody shields users from exchange failures and protocol hacks, it also puts them at risk of losing their holdings due to human error or technical failures. Without safeguards, investors can permanently lose access to their assets. Recent figures illustrate the scale of the issue. A January report from River estimated that around 1.6 million Bitcoin—worth over $1.5 billion at the time—had become inaccessible due to self-custody mismanagement. This amount exceeds the estimated 1.2 million BTC lost in exchange-related incidents. Considering this, Buterin urged the crypto industry to prioritize wallet security innovations that protect users from such irreversible losses. According to him: “The truly robust wallet security solutions that our ecosystem needs to build should take loss into account too. (This is a big part of why I talk about social recovery so much!).” Buterin has promoted social recovery wallets since 2021. This method employs a multi-signature system, allowing designated guardians to help users regain access to their funds. Social recovery wallets function like regular wallets, with a single key signing transaction. However, if users lose access, they can request that their guardians authorize a transaction to update the signing key. Buterin emphasized that this approach balances decentralization with enhanced security and reduces the risk of theft and permanent loss. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin\'s potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change.

See how this crypto project stands out.', 'content': 'Move over, boring cryptocurrencies – there’s a new frog in town. Pepeto isn’t just another cute face in the crypto world, though it’s definitely winning hearts with its playful frog god theme. What’s really turning heads is how this project has already pulled in a whopping $4.7 million from investors. While most meme coins are all about the jokes, Pepeto actually brings something useful to the table. They’ve managed to make crypto fun without sacrificing substance. Three key features have caught the attention of both casual traders and serious investors: zero-fee trading that eliminates transaction costs, a cross-chain bridge that enables seamless movement between different blockchains, and an attractive staking program offering 319% estimated rewards. The platform also introduces its own exchange specifically designed for meme tokens, aiming to solve common trading problems in the meme coin space. At the heart of Pepeto’s story lies an intriguing narrative about six sacred documents, each representing crucial elements: Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. The story goes that while another frog-themed token, Pepe, managed to acquire four of these documents, it missed the two most critical ones – Technology and Optimization. This oversight has become a central part of Pepeto’s value proposition in the cryptocurrency market. Unlike many meme-inspired cryptocurrencies that rely solely on social media hype, Pepeto has built its foundation on practical features. The project’s focus on technological advancement and system optimization has resonated with investors who are looking for more than just another trendy token. Perhaps the most talked-about feature of Pepeto is its zero-fee trading platform. Every time you make a trade, those pesky transaction costs nibble away at your potential gains. Whether you’re a day trader making multiple moves or just dipping your toes into crypto for the first time, trading without fees is a game-changer. The team didn’t stop there though. They’ve also built a pretty clever bridge system that lets you hop between different blockchains without breaking a sweat. Say goodbye to the days of having your crypto trapped on one network – now you can move your tokens wherever better opportunities pop up. Their bridge locks up your tokens on one chain and mints equivalent ones on another, keeping everything secure and running smoothly. « The market plays with emotions, but real winners play with strategy. Stay calm, stick to the plan and let the rebounds work for you » – $PEPETO – The God of frogs. \U0001f517 : https://t.co/uo5vOks5PH pic.twitter.com/uV9fV3jom3 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) February 8, 2025 Looking at the numbers, Pepeto’s staking program has turned heads with its impressive 319% estimated rewards. The project has allocated a significant portion of its 420 trillion total token supply specifically for staking rewards, showing a strong commitment to long-term holders. Speaking of token distribution, Pepeto has structured its allocation thoughtfully. The team has split up the $PEPETO tokens in a way that makes sense: they’ve put aside 30% each for the presale and staking rewards. They’ve carved out a decent chunk (20%) for getting the word out, while keeping enough in the tank for development (7.5%) and making sure there’s plenty of liquidity (12.5%) for smooth trading. The team behind Pepeto has laid out a comprehensive roadmap extending into 2025. The project has already completed several key phases, including smart contract audits and the establishment of community channels. Looking ahead, plans include the launch of a dedicated exchange platform, implementation of staking mechanisms, and continued expansion of their cross-chain capabilities. Multiple exchange listings are on the horizon, with the project aiming to secure spots on five major platforms. This strategic approach to listings could potentially increase accessibility and trading options for interested parties. Ready to join the Pepeto community? The process is easy and takes just a few minutes. An interesting feature of the platform is the immediate staking option – new buyers can start earning rewards right after their purchase by selecting the “Buy and Stake” option during checkout.

Their bridge locks up your tokens on one chain and mints equivalent ones on another, keeping everything secure and running smoothly. « The market plays with emotions, but real winners play with strategy. Stay calm, stick to the plan and let the rebounds work for you » – $PEPETO – The God of frogs. \U0001f517 : https://t.co/uo5vOks5PH pic.twitter.com/uV9fV3jom3 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) February 8, 2025 Looking at the numbers, Pepeto’s staking program has turned heads with its impressive 319% estimated rewards. The project has allocated a significant portion of its 420 trillion total token supply specifically for staking rewards, showing a strong commitment to long-term holders. Speaking of token distribution, Pepeto has structured its allocation thoughtfully. The team has split up the $PEPETO tokens in a way that makes sense: they’ve put aside 30% each for the presale and staking rewards. They’ve carved out a decent chunk (20%) for getting the word out, while keeping enough in the tank for development (7.5%) and making sure there’s plenty of liquidity (12.5%) for smooth trading. The team behind Pepeto has laid out a comprehensive roadmap extending into 2025. The project has already completed several key phases, including smart contract audits and the establishment of community channels. Looking ahead, plans include the launch of a dedicated exchange platform, implementation of staking mechanisms, and continued expansion of their cross-chain capabilities. Multiple exchange listings are on the horizon, with the project aiming to secure spots on five major platforms. This strategic approach to listings could potentially increase accessibility and trading options for interested parties. Ready to join the Pepeto community? The process is easy and takes just a few minutes. An interesting feature of the platform is the immediate staking option – new buyers can start earning rewards right after their purchase by selecting the “Buy and Stake” option during checkout.

2025-02-28 09:40:10,061 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin Dumps: Buy the Dip for Maximum BTC Bull Potential?', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/btc-dumps-buy-the-dip-for-max-btc-bull-potential/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Bitcoin Dumps: Buy the Dip for Maximum BTC Bull Potential?', 'description': 'Bitcoin dropped 18% in a week, but with strong macro factors, should you buy the dip? Discover why the BTC Bull potential for major gains in 2025.', 'content': 'What’s happening to Bitcoin? Only a week ago, the leading crypto was trading above $98K. Now, it’s hovering right around $80K, down 18% in seven days. Unlike other major crashes it’s hard to pinpoint an exact cause of the panic. The last time the Fear & Greed index was this low, it was the Terra/Luna crash; a clear case of a single, shocking event that had major negative ramifications. That’s not the case now. The Bybit hack was major; the largest crypto hack ever. But the response initially was muted, and if it’s the hack that’s causing the massive selloff now, it’s more due to the added liquidity, rather than the event itself. The situation becomes even more confusing when you look at the broader market. Macro factors remain positive. U.S. President Trump’s ongoing reshaping of the regulatory environment continues apace, with the news that the SEC just completely dropped an enforcement action against Coinbase. In its decision, the agency actually went so far as to expressly indicate that it was going to ‘rectify its approach’ to crypto regulation: ‘The Commission’s decision to exercise its discretion and dismiss this pending enforcement action rests on its judgment that the dismissal will facilitate the Commission’s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry’ – SEC Announces Dismissal of Civil Enforcement Action Against Coinbase That removes a major obstacle to crypto’s adoption in the US. So why the doom and gloom? It could be simple supply and demand. The recent Bybit hack siphoned huge amounts of $ETH out of the exchange, and the hackers have begun swapping $ETH for $BTC to the tune of roughly $480M. But since the long-term outlook remains positive, the dip might be the perfect buying opportunity to unlock $BTC gains and BTC Bull’s potential. $BTCBULL provides not one, not two, but three ways to profit. The first is the price increase of the Ethereum-based $BTCBULL token. As the project powers through its presale with $2.9M raised so far, investors have the chance to get in at low prices – potentially the lowest prices ever for the token (currently $0.002385). The second is through $BTCBULL staking. Right now, buying and staking $BTCBULL during the presale offers returns of 146% PA, disbursed over 2 years after the token launches. Last but not least, $BTCBULL holders will be eligible for $BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin’s price reaches key indicators. At $150K and $250K, BTC Bull holders using the Best Wallet app will receive BTC airdropped directly into their wallets. BTC Bull isn’t just riding BTC’s coattails. By incorporating regular $BTCBULL token burns, the project aims to control liquidity and reward hodlers. Staking rewards come over the course of two years, providing further incentive for long-term ecosystem growth for the BTC Bull token. $BTC’s record as one of the world’s best-performing asset class, with an average annual return of 230%, is ripe for the memecoin treatment. BTC Bull’s current presale success also positions it on a short list of the best crypto presales to invest in right now. Yes, $BTC is down right now. But at this point last year, $BTC traded around $61K. It’s still up – way up – from previous levels. Bybit may have flooded the market, but Bitcoin is down – not out. And when it comes back, $BTCBULL is ready to rise with it. Of course, make your own decisions, based off your own research; you can look more into how to buy BTC Bull here. None of this is financial advice, and the crypto market is always volatile. Just remember that Bitcoin’s gains tend to transfer to other tokens also. And now, for the first time, there’s a Bitcoin-focused memecoin, BTC Bull, poised to move in lock-step with the OG crypto.'}

This comes as South Korean authorities are tightening their grip on crypto-related crimes by launching a dedicated unit to handle digital asset investigations. On Feb. 28, Dunamu reportedly filed a lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court seeking to overturn the FIU’s sanctions. Last November, South Korean regulators accused Upbit of failing to conduct proper customer due diligence in hundreds of thousands of cases. Due to this, the FIU barred the exchange’s new customers from transferring virtual assets on Upbit between March 7 and June 6 However, Dunamu has challenged this position, arguing that the penalty will significantly impact its operations. Dunamu insisted that it has taken necessary compliance measures in response to regulatory concerns and believes the sanctions are disproportionate. The firm also claimed that the FIU sanctions were made without fully considering key facts and circumstances. In a parallel development, South Korea’s Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office has launched a specialized Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) to combat cryptocurrency-related crimes, as local media reported on Feb. 27. According to the report, the newly established unit comprises 35 financial regulators and prosecutors from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. Their primary focus is investigating and prosecuting crypto-related fraud, theft, and illicit market activities. The authorities introduced this initiative following the success of a temporary task force set up in 2023 to combat rising cryptocurrency-related offenses. The increasing complexity of these crimes prompted the creation of a permanent unit to ensure more effective enforcement. Since the launch of the initial task force, prosecutors have charged 74 individuals and arrested 25 in cases involving fraudulent schemes and market manipulation.

2025-02-28 11:09:11,071 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin Insights Reveal 80% Correlation With The S&P500 – Analyst Prepares For Another Drop', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-insights-reveal-80-correlation-with-the-sp500-analyst-prepares-for-another-drop/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Bitcoin Insights Reveal 80% Correlation With The S&P500 – Analyst Prepares For Another Drop | Bitcoinist.com', 'description': 'Bitcoin (BTC) loses key support, down 28% from highs. 80% correlation with S&P 500 adds macro uncertainty. Will BTC stabilize?', 'content': 'Bitcoin has lost crucial support levels as the market struggles to find demand, allowing bears to gain momentum. Analysts are calling for further corrections, with fear dominating sentiment across the crypto market. Bitcoin has now dropped over 28% from its late January highs, and concerns are mounting that bears could take prices even lower in the coming weeks. The broader financial markets are also facing uncertainty, adding to Bitcoin’s struggles. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that BTC currently has an 80% correlation with the S&P 500 index, meaning that movements in traditional markets are heavily influencing Bitcoin’s price action. This suggests that macro factors, such as interest rate expectations and stock market trends, could play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s next move. While some analysts believe BTC could stabilize around current levels, others warn that the ongoing downtrend could continue, bringing Bitcoin into lower demand zones if bulls fail to reclaim control. The next few days will be critical, as Bitcoin’s ability to hold key levels or break lower could define its short-term and long-term trajectory in this volatile market environment. Bitcoin has experienced a massive correction, with fear dominating the market as risks of further declines grow. The situation is not just limited to crypto—the U.S. stock market is also struggling, failing to confirm an uptrend amid growing economic uncertainty. Over the past few weeks, volatility and uncertainty have intensified, especially as Trump’s policies come into effect, impacting both traditional and digital asset markets. Top analyst Axel Adler shared an analysis on X, revealing that the S&P 500 is likely to pull back another 5% based on the macro reports he read. This is significant because Bitcoin currently has an 80% correlation with the index, meaning that any further downside in traditional markets could directly impact BTC’s price action. If Adler’s prediction is accurate, Bitcoin is likely to continue its price drops, with a potential move into lower demand levels. The next few weeks will be crucial\xa0as Bitcoin struggles to find strong support. With macro uncertainty rising and investors remaining fearful, BTC must hold above key demand zones to avoid an extended bearish phase. If stocks recover, BTC could follow—but if the S&P 500 pulls back further, BTC could see even more downside before finding stability. Bitcoin is trading at $80,200 after a very bearish end to the week and month, reinforcing concerns of a continued price decline. The market is in fear mode, with bears maintaining momentum as BTC fails to reclaim key support levels. The recent breakdown has led to speculation about whether the bull cycle is over or if this is just another deep correction before another leg up. However, there is still hope for a recovery if bulls can hold the crucial $80K level. This price has been tested multiple times recently, and a strong defense here could lead to a reversal. If BTC reclaims $85K–$90K in the coming weeks, sentiment could shift, allowing for a potential bounce into higher price levels. Still, failure to hold above $80K could result in another sharp sell-off, potentially driving BTC down toward $75K or lower. The coming days will be critical as Bitcoin approaches a make-or-break moment. Bulls need to step up and push BTC back above resistance levels to prevent further losses, but the overall trend remains bearish until key levels are reclaimed.

The Commissioner also took issue with the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance for its stance that memecoins do not qualify as securities under federal law, arguing that this position lacks legal foundation and clarity. Over the past week, the SEC has dropped multiple lawsuits against major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini. This shift follows the formation of a specialized crypto task force aimed at developing future regulations. While the SEC attributes these dismissals to ongoing regulatory considerations, Crenshaw argues that enforcement should not be abandoned while new policies are still in development. She wrote: “Should the Commission enact new regulations or Congress change the law, we can progress down a different path. But until that time, we have a framework in place and that framework should be applied and enforced equally as to all participants.” The Commissioner argued the courts have consistently affirmed the SEC’s authority over crypto, citing the example of the now-dismissed Coinbase lawsuit. In that lawsuit, Crenshaw argued that the agency had already established a strong legal case, with the court agreeing “that the Commission adequately pleaded violations of the securities laws.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner questioned whether these decisions weaken the SEC’s ability to combat fraud, including Ponzi schemes, and whether digital assets are now being given preferential treatment over traditional financial instruments. She also warned that selective enforcement could erode trust in the SEC and fuel perceptions of political bias. She concluded: “Our agency’s job is to do what is right for investors, issuers, and capital markets. This is not it.” Crenshaw also criticized the SEC’s recent guidance on memecoins, arguing that it presents an incomplete and legally unsupported view. She questioned the lack of a clear definition for memecoins, noting that the guidance loosely describes them as speculative assets influenced by online trends. However, she pointed out that these characteristics apply broadly to most digital assets, making the distinction unclear. She questioned: “And exactly what is a meme coin, the category to which this guidance is directed? Other than how a promoter chooses to label it, what basis do we have to determine whether something is a meme coin?” She further argued that labeling a token as a memecoin does not exempt it from securities laws. The Howey test, which determines whether an asset qualifies as a security, focuses on the economic realities of an offering rather than its branding. [Editor’s Note: It is also based on the sale of Floridian orange groves in 1934, almost 100 years ago. It was designed for real estate, leaseback agreements, and agricultural investments, not blockchain-based digital assets.] Crenshaw warned that promoters could exploit the lack of definition to sidestep regulation. Another key issue, Crenshaw noted, is the assumption that memecoin prices move independently of managerial efforts. She argued that project teams frequently influence market conditions through supply manipulation, buybacks, and strategic marketing campaigns. Fraudulent schemes such as pump-and-dumps and rug pulls remain prevalent in the sector, emphasizing the need for strong oversight. Concluding her remarks, Crenshaw stated that the SEC’s current approach does little to protect investors or uphold the integrity of financial markets. Instead, it introduces ambiguity and weakens enforcement efforts, leaving room for regulatory gaps that bad actors could exploit. She wrote: “This guidance is not a reasoned interpretation of existing law. It raises more questions than it answers about what a meme coin is and whether that is a definable or useful categorization for purposes of the existing securities laws.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin\'s potential.

The filing, submitted on Feb. 24, by DTTM Operations LLC to the US Patent and Trademark Office, reveals plans for a proprietary “TRUMP” mark that will underpin a suite of digital offerings, including a metaverse environment and an NFT marketplace. The trademark documentation outlines a vision for a virtual ecosystem where users can interact in immersive digital spaces. The planned metaverse is slated to feature branded digital wearables, virtual dining establishments, and interactive venues. It is also expected to host educational and professional services that span business, real estate, public service, and fundraising — efforts aimed at bridging traditional sectors with emerging technology. This latest filing builds on a series of digital ventures undertaken by Trump and his affiliated businesses. Earlier this year, the Official TRUMP memecoin was introduced amid President Donald Trump’s inauguration, while last year’s debut of World Liberty Financial helped position the Trump brand within the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Additional forays have included Bitcoin-themed merchandise and recent trademark applications by Trump Media and Technology Group for a range of crypto investment products and NFT collectibles. Further emphasizing the commitment to digital innovation, the Trump-backed Truth.Fi financial services firm was unveiled earlier this month with plans to deploy up to $250 million in blockchain-related investments. The firm’s focus on emerging digital finance models indicates the Trump Organization’s broader strategy to diversify its portfolio beyond traditional industries. While details on the rollout and specific features of the metaverse and NFT platform remain under wraps, market watchers predict that the integrated digital ecosystem could be operational by late 2025. Observers note that as legacy brands adapt to the digital age, initiatives like these could reshape consumer interactions with both virtual and tangible assets.

Stay informed on the go. SEC\'s policy shifts prompt Crenshaw to challenge memecoin categorization and enforcement abandonment. Crypto sentiment plummeting to "extreme fear" after $918 million in leveraged positions are liquidated.

Nate Geraci, CEO of The ETF Store, noted that the development “definitely bodes well” for SOL exchange-traded fund (ETF) prospects. According to a Feb. 28 statement, the new Solana futures contracts will be available in two sizes: a 25 SOL micro-contract and a 500 SOL larger contract. CME Group stated that these offerings are designed to accommodate a wide range of market participants, from institutional investors to active traders. Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, highlighted that the launch aims to address increasing client demand. He added: “As Solana continues to evolve into the platform of choice for developers and investors, these new futures contracts will provide a capital-efficient tool to support their investment and hedging strategies.” Moreover, industry figures such as Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani and Bitwise’s Teddy Fusaro noted that introducing SOL futures is a sign of market maturation, as sophisticated tools to manage crypto exposure are needed. CME Group’s Solana futures will be cash-settled and benchmarked against the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. The reference rate provides a standardized daily valuation of Solana in US dollars. Analysts view futures contracts as a spot crypto ETF approval requirement, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have followed this path. Gaining futures contracts could boost the chances of an SOL ETF approval. According to Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of a Solana ETF being approved in the US this year are 70%. The SEC recently acknowledged spot SOL ETF filings from five issuers earlier in February. The documents were later included in the Federal Register between Feb. 12 and 18, meaning the SEC now has 240 days to respond to the filings, ending on Oct. 16. JPMorgan’s estimate, based on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs’ flows, predicted that Solana ETFs could capture $3 billion to $6 billion in net flows.

He added: “As Solana continues to evolve into the platform of choice for developers and investors, these new futures contracts will provide a capital-efficient tool to support their investment and hedging strategies.” Moreover, industry figures such as Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani and Bitwise’s Teddy Fusaro noted that introducing SOL futures is a sign of market maturation, as sophisticated tools to manage crypto exposure are needed. CME Group’s Solana futures will be cash-settled and benchmarked against the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. The reference rate provides a standardized daily valuation of Solana in US dollars. Analysts view futures contracts as a spot crypto ETF approval requirement, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have followed this path. Gaining futures contracts could boost the chances of an SOL ETF approval. According to Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of a Solana ETF being approved in the US this year are 70%. The SEC recently acknowledged spot SOL ETF filings from five issuers earlier in February. The documents were later included in the Federal Register between Feb. 12 and 18, meaning the SEC now has 240 days to respond to the filings, ending on Oct. 16. JPMorgan’s estimate, based on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs’ flows, predicted that Solana ETFs could capture $3 billion to $6 billion in net flows.

The asset manager has assigned 1% to 2% of its target allocation portfolios to IBIT. As of Dec. 17, the fund registered over $36 billion in net flows, amassing more inflows than any ETF launched since 2014. According to the report, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility prompted BlackRock, in a December report from the BlackRock Investment Institute, to define a 1% to 2% allocation as a “reasonable range.” The document noted that exceeding a 2% allocation could disproportionately increase the cryptocurrency’s impact on overall portfolio risk. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, stated: “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” Additionally, Eve Cout, head of portfolio design and solutions for US Wealth at BlackRock, noted that investors want to allocate more to alternatives. Still, they need guidance on the position’s size, scale, and rebalance. The decision comes amid IBIT registering $930 million in outflows in the past four days. On Feb. 26, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF experienced its largest daily outflow, with $418 million in capital leaving the fund. Despite the recent woes, IBIT currently holds over $48 billion in assets and displays nearly $40 billion in net flows per data from Bold Report and Farside Investors. Notably, the firm doubled its Bitcoin exposure in its Global Allocation Fund last year, reporting 430,770 shares of IBIT in its third-quarter 13F Form. The amount was 117% larger than the 198,874 shares reported for the second quarter. BlackRock’s addition of Bitcoin to its model portfolio is a much-needed positive development that could boost market sentiment amid falling prices.

However, uncertainty remains over how digital assets will be taxed, a key issue that could impact the country’s growing crypto sector.\xa0Ukraine is exploring a crypto tax rate between 5% and 10% as part of its broader efforts to regulate the digital asset market while generating revenue for the state budget and military funding. However, officials are also considering applying the standard taxation framework, which would impose an 18% income tax plus a 5% military levy, bringing the total tax burden on crypto earnings to 23%. The final decision remains under discussion as lawmakers work toward passing a comprehensive regulatory framework, with legislation expected to be finalized by mid-2025. Danil Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s finance, tax, and customs committee, said he expects the legislation’s first reading by the end of March and a second reading soon after.\xa0If the bill moves forward as planned, it could be enacted by mid-2025. However, some officials remain skeptical about the timeline. Taras Kozak, a member of the Kyiv City Council and president of the investment group “UNIVER,” suggested the process may take longer. Kozak said in an interview: “I’m optimistic that the bill will pass by the end of the year, but full legalization and taxation will likely come into effect in 2026.” Ukraine has emerged as a leader in crypto adoption, with digital assets playing a vital role in financial transactions and donations since Russia’s invasion in 2022. The country has embraced blockchain technology to support its economy, but legal uncertainties have hindered mainstream integration. The pending legislation aims to establish clear guidelines for the use and taxation of cryptocurrencies. While the exact tax structure has yet to be finalized, officials have hinted at a possible flat-rate tax or a tiered system based on trading volume. Kozak said that “Ukraine needs a competitive regulatory framework” and warned that overly complex taxation could push businesses and investors toward offshore platforms. Despite strong political support, the process has faced delays. In 2021, Ukraine passed a law recognizing cryptocurrencies, but it required additional amendments to align with EU standards. The current bill seeks to address those gaps, ensuring compliance with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing regulations. Hetmantsev emphasized the urgency of passing the legislation, arguing that delays could hinder Ukraine’s ability to attract foreign investment in blockchain-based industries. He said: “We are doing everything possible to expedite the process.” If the law is enacted, Ukraine will join a growing list of countries formally integrating digital assets into their financial and tax systems. However, industry leaders stress that taxation policies will play a crucial role in determining whether the market flourishes or struggles under regulatory pressure.

2025-02-28 17:10:51,317 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Dogecoin’s Price To Shift Upward As DOGE Enters High-Demand Order Block Zone', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-in-order-block-zone/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': "Dogecoin's Price To Shift Upward As DOGE Enters High-Demand Order Block Zone | Bitcoinist.com", 'description': 'Dogecoin has been facing bearish pressure, but market expert and investor Trader Tardigrade has revealed a bullish trend in its recent price action.', 'content': 'After a brief display of bullish momentum on Thursday, Dogecoin began its bearish price action, falling as low as $0.201. In 1 month, DOGE’s price has declined by almost 40%, triggering speculations about a possible bear market phase. However, the dog-themed meme coin could still experience a rebound as it moves into a key zone. Dogecoin has been facing bearish pressure, causing its price to retest previous support levels. Meanwhile, market expert and investor Trader Tardigrade has revealed a bullish trend in DOGE’s recent price action. Delving into Dogecoin’s price action, Trader Tardigrader highlighted that the meme coin has entered a crucial order block zone for substantial buying or selling activity that may determine the stock’s future trajectory. Order block zones during heightened volatility often serve as strong support or resistance levels. Many large concentrations of limit orders are currently waiting to be executed in this zone. When this zone is filled with orders, Trader Tardigrade is confident that DOGE will move to the upside in the upcoming weeks. The experts anticipate an uptrend for DOGE since past scenarios preceded significant rallies in the following weeks, as seen on the daily chart. Should buying pressure increase as DOGE trades within this order block zone, this could ignite bullish momentum, allowing it to reclaim key resistance levels and possibly a new all-time high. A key pattern cited in the 4-hour time frame chart is further backing DOGE’s potential for an uptrend. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade noted that the meme coin has formed a Double Bottom chart pattern, an indicator that usually signals an upward trend. If Dogecoin effectively performs the bottoming chart formation, it is expected to resume its upward movement. Looking at the expert’s chart, the pattern could cause a rebound to the $0.22 level in the following days. While the double bottom hints at growing momentum, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has undergone a bullish breakout from a horizontal resistance line. This breakout is likely to support the meme coin‘s anticipated price recovery triggered by the bottoming pattern. Dogecoin’s Open Interest (OI) has declined sharply along with its waning price movements. Technical expert Ali Martinez reported an over 67% decrease in DOGE’s open interest over the past 3 months. This represents a drop from its all-time high of $4.07 billion in December to about $1.33 billion today. Surprisingly, investors are beginning to demonstrate interest in DOGE amid the current price drop. On-chain data shows that large investors or whales have returned to the market, heavily acquiring Dogecoin. These whales have accumulated more than 530 million DOGE in the past 72 hours, signaling confidence in its long-term prospects.'}

Lawmakers have argued that creating a dedicated crypto reserve prepares Arizona for an inevitable federal regulatory framework and positions the state to harness emerging financial technologies to safeguard public funds amid a volatile economic landscape. The legislature approved the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve bill (SB 1373) on its third reading by a 17–12 vote. Sponsored by Republican Sen. Mark Finchem, the measure would create a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund managed by the state treasurer. The fund would combine state-appropriated dollars with digital assets seized by law enforcement while limiting investments to no more than 10% of total deposits in any fiscal year. Under the proposal, the treasurer could also loan digital assets to generate returns, provided that such actions do not elevate financial risk. Meanwhile, a second measure — the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025) — received a 17–11 vote. Co-sponsored by Republican Sen. Wendy Rogers and Rep. Jeff Weninger, the proposal aims to empower public funds to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Both bills now advance to the state House for further debate. Arizona’s legislative push is part of a broader national trend as states explore ways to integrate digital assets into public finance. Several states have crypto reserve proposals pending in their states, with Utah and Texas among those making significant progress. Lawmakers in Utah have successfully passed crucial votes and committee reviews for their crypto reserve bill, positioning it closer to a final vote and eventual approval. Meanwhile,\xa0Texas has also progressed — with Senate Bill 21 recently passing its senate banking committee vote — to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In contrast, similar initiatives in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Pennsylvania have been rejected, reflecting a mixed approach across the nation. Proponents argue that establishing state-managed digital reserves is a proactive strategy to modernize public finance and build resilience amid economic volatility. However, critics have cautioned that the inherent risks of the crypto market require a careful and measured approach. As debates continue at both the state and national levels, the outcomes in Utah, Arizona, Texas, and other key states may set important precedents for how digital assets are managed in public finance, potentially influencing future federal legislation.

According to the lender’s head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick, the downside risk is driven by\xa0continued ETF outflows and mounting hedge fund short position. Kendrick detailed growing concerns over the market’s recent weakness and lamented the absence of extended breaks enjoyed by other markets. He said: “It is at the end of weeks like this that digital asset participants wish the asset class closed for the weekend.” He added that Bitcoin’s drop below $80,000 — once a key resistance level following Trump’s election victory — raises questions about how far the sell-off might go. Kendrick’s analysis pointed to significant ETF activity as a harbinger of further declines. He noted that Bitcoin ETF outflows almost touched $1 billion on Feb. 25, which is a critical threshold. Despite the significant outflows, Kendrick believes the sell pressure may not be over. He also highlighted a growing disconnect between ETF positioning and hedge fund short exposure based on CFTC data. Kendrick observed that since the US election, ETF positions surged from $23.5 billion to a peak of $40.2 billion — now down to $37.0 billion — while hedge fund shorts climbed from $7.9 billion to $11.3 billion as of Feb. 18. Kendrick noted: “ETF positions are up 71% since Nov. 5, but hedge fund shorts are up only 43%. This implies there is still a lot (the majority) of outright longs in the ETFs. To the degree these stem from underlying retail flow I think they remain at risk of panic selling.” Kendrick revisited his earlier caution regarding downside risks, warning that Bitcoin’s key convexity risk level of $90,000 had been breached. He had said earlier in the week: “While BTC trades relatively well within the digital asset complex, it is now caught up in the broader risk-off sentiment.” Kendrick added that lower US Treasury yields might offer long-term support even as near-term sentiment remains bleak but cautioned against buying the dip before a more decisive dip. Looking ahead to the weekend, Kendrick expressed skepticism that risk assets would rally given looming geopolitical tensions and tariff implementations. He said: “Probably fair to assume we have had the Trump tariff noise now… But are risk assets really going to rally into the weekend now we have had the bad news? I doubt it.” Recalling a similar period in August 2024 — when panic selling pushed Bitcoin below $50,000 after a rapid 5.5% decline — he noted that another drop of similar magnitude could see Bitcoin slide into the $69,000 to $76,500 range.

Despite near-term volatility, Kendrick expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 this year and as high as $500,000 before the end of President Trump’s term. Kendrick opened the discussion\xa0by noting the influence of political developments on investor sentiment: “So I think the Trump Administration will be positive medium term. So we came into January 20, hoping for quite a lot and you could argue there was already quite a lot of positivity priced in.” He highlighted the immediate post-inauguration shift in regulatory stance—specifically, the removal of SAB 121, which he described as having “been hampering financial institutions.” Kendrick also addressed the lack of a widely anticipated strategic Bitcoin reserve, replaced instead by a “stockpile” approach. According to Kendrick: “The stockpile for me is okay because it legitimizes other sovereigns […] both within the US [and outside]. A number of US states are considering holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet.” Still, markets have been rattled by fresh uncertainties. Kendrick pointed to ongoing trade war and geopolitical flashpoints: “Initiatives in the last couple of weeks have been very confusing for risk assets […] tariffs on and off. Canada, Mexico, EU […] obviously some potential positives coming around Ukraine and or the Middle East but nothing solid really on any of those and risk assets don’t like uncertainty.” Within the crypto sphere specifically, he cited the Bybit hack, trouble with the Solana meme coin scams, and a generally “confusing” environment as contributors to the pullback. Kendrick underscored the cascading effect on Bitcoin. When asked whether Bitcoin remains a genuine diversifier amid its correlation with equities, Kendrick maintained a nuanced view: “Certainly when we see large moves like we’ve seen in the last few weeks […] on the negative direction risk assets all trade together […] Medium-term, I think the diversification story is reasonable […] The use case for Bitcoin in particular is to diversify against risks around traditional financial markets.” Kendrick also addressed the large outflows from the spot ETFs since Trump’s inauguration: “Even in the last week, we’ve seen about $3 billion of outflows in terms of ETFs […] we got to a net position of about $40 billion of inflows over the first 12 months of those ETFs in the US […] but in the last week or so we’ve seen $3 billion of outflows.” He estimates that those who bought Bitcoin post-election in November are now “heavily underwater” to the tune of $2 billion in paper losses. This newer cohort of holders, combined with the sector’s still-robust retail participation, has amplified volatility: “It’s much more difficult for investors then to hold through losses […] when you see moves like we saw this week, you tend to get some panic selling.” He also reiterated the need for deeper institutional participation—citing banks like Standard Chartered and investment giants such as BlackRock—to improve custody solutions and reduce the frequency of such hacks like the Bybit one, leading to damaging headlines: “As the industry becomes more institutionalized it should be safer […] hopefully we get some regulatory clarity in the US too […] that should add to that medium-term top side potential which for me is Bitcoin up to $200,000 this year and $500,000 before Trump leaves office.” Looking ahead, Kendrick underscored that regulatory clarity—particularly around stablecoin rules and KYC—could trigger a wave of institutional and even sovereign capital inflows. He identified long-term public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds as pivotal market movers, referencing the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund’s purchase of 4,700 BTC-equivalent shares in the BlackRock ETF at the end of 2024: “There’s that very long-term sector that is still to participate more […] and then also Sovereign so the only Sovereign that we know so far has bought the ETFs is Abu Sovereign wealth fund […] I’d expect more of that to come through this year as well.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,428.'}

2025-02-28 20:07:50,050 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'Bitcoin Crashes, But Standard Chartered Sees $200,000 In 2025', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-crash-standard-chartered-200000-in-2025/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': 'Bitcoin Crashes, But Standard Chartered Sees $200,000 In 2025', 'description': 'Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 this year.', 'content': 'In an interview with CNBC’s Street Signs on February 27, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, offered insights on Bitcoin’s recent price decline and laid out a bold forecast for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Despite near-term volatility, Kendrick expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 this year and as high as $500,000 before the end of President Trump’s term. Kendrick opened the discussion\xa0by noting the influence of political developments on investor sentiment: “So I think the Trump Administration will be positive medium term. So we came into January 20, hoping for quite a lot and you could argue there was already quite a lot of positivity priced in.” He highlighted the immediate post-inauguration shift in regulatory stance—specifically, the removal of SAB 121, which he described as having “been hampering financial institutions.” Kendrick also addressed the lack of a widely anticipated strategic Bitcoin reserve, replaced instead by a “stockpile” approach. According to Kendrick: “The stockpile for me is okay because it legitimizes other sovereigns […] both within the US [and outside]. A number of US states are considering holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet.” Still, markets have been rattled by fresh uncertainties. Kendrick pointed to ongoing trade war and geopolitical flashpoints: “Initiatives in the last couple of weeks have been very confusing for risk assets […] tariffs on and off. Canada, Mexico, EU […] obviously some potential positives coming around Ukraine and or the Middle East but nothing solid really on any of those and risk assets don’t like uncertainty.” Within the crypto sphere specifically, he cited the Bybit hack, trouble with the Solana meme coin scams, and a generally “confusing” environment as contributors to the pullback. Kendrick underscored the cascading effect on Bitcoin. When asked whether Bitcoin remains a genuine diversifier amid its correlation with equities, Kendrick maintained a nuanced view: “Certainly when we see large moves like we’ve seen in the last few weeks […] on the negative direction risk assets all trade together […] Medium-term, I think the diversification story is reasonable […] The use case for Bitcoin in particular is to diversify against risks around traditional financial markets.” Kendrick also addressed the large outflows from the spot ETFs since Trump’s inauguration: “Even in the last week, we’ve seen about $3 billion of outflows in terms of ETFs […] we got to a net position of about $40 billion of inflows over the first 12 months of those ETFs in the US […] but in the last week or so we’ve seen $3 billion of outflows.” He estimates that those who bought Bitcoin post-election in November are now “heavily underwater” to the tune of $2 billion in paper losses. This newer cohort of holders, combined with the sector’s still-robust retail participation, has amplified volatility: “It’s much more difficult for investors then to hold through losses […] when you see moves like we saw this week, you tend to get some panic selling.” He also reiterated the need for deeper institutional participation—citing banks like Standard Chartered and investment giants such as BlackRock—to improve custody solutions and reduce the frequency of such hacks like the Bybit one, leading to damaging headlines: “As the industry becomes more institutionalized it should be safer […] hopefully we get some regulatory clarity in the US too […] that should add to that medium-term top side potential which for me is Bitcoin up to $200,000 this year and $500,000 before Trump leaves office.” Looking ahead, Kendrick underscored that regulatory clarity—particularly around stablecoin rules and KYC—could trigger a wave of institutional and even sovereign capital inflows. He identified long-term public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds as pivotal market movers, referencing the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund’s purchase of 4,700 BTC-equivalent shares in the BlackRock ETF at the end of 2024: “There’s that very long-term sector that is still to participate more […] and then also Sovereign so the only Sovereign that we know so far has bought the ETFs is Abu Sovereign wealth fund […] I’d expect more of that to come through this year as well.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,428.'}

He said in a Feb. 28 X post: “Honest, direct feedback: flowery language and a counsel of random people on twitter is not what people have been asking for.” Adams added that he is not criticizing the 15 names chosen for the advisory group but rather the idea and message behind the initiative, which he believes does not allay the community’s recent concerns. The Ethereum community has voiced concerns over the perceived disconnect between the Foundation’s current initiatives and the practical, transparent communication they expect. There is also unease about the ongoing structural changes and treasury management practices, which many feel have direct implications on ETH’s market performance. According to an EF statement, the Silviculture Society comprises names from outside the Foundation who have been picked to provide “informal counsel.” The goal is to ensure the Foundation maintains its “core values of open source, privacy, security, and censorship resistance.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s (ETH) co-founder, responded to Adams’ post, saying: “It is an experimental effort to create more channels for builders and other community voices to influence the EF, and in this case the scope is core cypherpunk and regen values. They have already given advice on timely and critical topics such as wallet security.” He added that the EF does not pay the Silviculture Society, and the group has a one-year term. Additionally, Buterin shared that more initiatives and structures will be formed to capture community feedback. Following Buterin’s explanation, Adams called the initiative “reasonable.” However, reiterated that EF needs to communicate in a “more direct and clear” format like Buterin’s response. The creation of the Silviculture Society comes amid a broad movement to restructure the Ethereum Foundation, which has consequently led to concerns among the community regarding its stability and long-term vision. On Feb. 25, Aya Miyaguchi\xa0stepped down from her role as EF executive director and moved to a new position as the Foundation’s president. The Foundation has yet to name a replacement. Miyaguchi and Buterin also mentioned creating a new “leadership structure” for EF but did not share further details about the plan. The community has scrutinized the EF over the past few months for ETH’s underperformance in 2024 compared to other major cryptocurrencies. The frequent selling of ETH raised questions about the effectiveness of the EF’s treasury management, as the public realization of these assets has impacted ETH’s price.

Join the presale now!', 'content': 'A new player in the cryptocurrency world is making bold claims about taking over the meme coin space. Pepeto, a frog-themed digital currency currently in its presale phase, is positioning itself as a technological upgrade to the popular PEPE token. It is weaving together ancient mythology with modern crypto innovations. The project’s creators have crafted an elaborate origin story centered around Pepeto. The character is described as an ancient frog deity who traveled through time collecting sacred knowledge. According to the mythology, Pepeto gathered six fundamental documents from various civilizations: Power and Energy from ancient Sumer, Precision from China’s mathematical scholars, Efficiency from Egypt’s master builders, and finally Technology and Optimization from the modern era. Where the story takes an interesting turn is in its relationship to the existing PEPE cryptocurrency. The project’s narrative suggests that PEPE, in its hunger for dominance, managed to steal four of these sacred documents but missed the two most crucial ones: Technology and Optimization. This creative storytelling serves to highlight what Pepeto’s developers see as their key technological advantages over their predecessor. Beyond the mythology, Pepeto introduces several practical features aimed at addressing common meme coin challenges. The project includes a staking system that rewards long-term holders, potentially helping to stabilize token prices. The staking rewards are available from the presale, currently rewarding users with over 300% APY. Those who join early might enjoy more rewards than those who join later on, as the reward is dynamic and could continue to reduce as more funds are sent into the staking pool. Pepeto will introduce a cross-chain bridge that aims to improve trading between different cryptocurrencies. It is created to use a lock-and-mint mechanism where assets are locked from the source chain and a corresponding amount is minted on the destination chain when carrying out transfer transactions. There is also a Pepeto exchange that offers zero fees for listing. Using the exchange also comes at no cost. The exchange is built to cover liquidity with easy access to various meme coins. However, entry will be by merit. The ease of entry is meant to boost liquidity on the platform. There are also various activities to ensure that Pepeto Exchange offers top security and enhanced protection. Scam-prone tokens won’t be listed on the platform to continuously protect the users. Various factors point to the possibility of PEPETO being a 100x token following its presale. Let’s look at some of them one after the other. One of the factors that suggest the token could see some major increases after the presale is the ongoing presale success. The presale has seen more than $4.7 million in funding, with more investors expected to come into the ecosystem with time. This large funding within the ecosystem suggests that investors believe in what it offers. If this continues, it could help it see quick growth post-presale. Pepeto, the God of Frogs: “It’s Not Hype… It’s the Beginning of Something Bigger” – An Interstellar Moment in Crypto \U0001f517 : https://t.co/RyI7SlT0Mh pic.twitter.com/mjlMkwjH1z — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) December 17, 2024 Pepeto developers aim to list it on at least five exchanges following launch. This is expected to create some liquidity for the project and more visibility. Having these could position PEPETO for larger trading volumes and quick adoption. With Pepeto going ahead to offer utility that many meme coins lack, the project could let users see reasons to come into the ecosystem to carry out various bridging and exchange activities. This could give a reason for many investors to come back, potentially increasing the value of the token. The project also has plans to grow, with the structured roadmap detailed on its website. The roadmap is in four phases. The various plans emphasize community engagement and exchange listings. There will also be utility through its bridge and exchange features. The plans also cover sustainability initiatives through staking and continued marketing efforts. The developers believe their focus on technology and optimization will help Pepeto avoid the price volatility that has affected other meme coins. PEPETO token is priced at $0.000000112. Investors can participate using various cryptocurrencies, including ETH, USDT, and BNB, or even with credit card payments. The platform supports multiple wallet options, recommending MetaMask for desktop users and Best Wallet for mobile transactions. All investors need to do is connect their decentralized wallets to the website and follow the prompts to secure their desired number of tokens.

2025-02-28 22:52:02,086 - INFO - Sample new article: {'headline': 'New Cryptocurrency Pepeto Takes Aim at PEPE’s Meme Coin Crown: Here’s Why', 'url': 'https://bitcoinist.com/new-cryptocurrency-pepeto-takes-aim-at-pepes-meme-coin-crown-heres-why/', 'source': 'bitcoinist.com', 'title': "New Cryptocurrency Pepeto Takes Aim at PEPE's Meme Coin Crown: Here’s Why | Bitcoinist.com", 'description': 'Pepeto revolutionizes the meme coin market with unique features, staking rewards, and a rich mythology. Join the presale now!', 'content': 'A new player in the cryptocurrency world is making bold claims about taking over the meme coin space. Pepeto, a frog-themed digital currency currently in its presale phase, is positioning itself as a technological upgrade to the popular PEPE token. It is weaving together ancient mythology with modern crypto innovations. The project’s creators have crafted an elaborate origin story centered around Pepeto. The character is described as an ancient frog deity who traveled through time collecting sacred knowledge. According to the mythology, Pepeto gathered six fundamental documents from various civilizations: Power and Energy from ancient Sumer, Precision from China’s mathematical scholars, Efficiency from Egypt’s master builders, and finally Technology and Optimization from the modern era. Where the story takes an interesting turn is in its relationship to the existing PEPE cryptocurrency. The project’s narrative suggests that PEPE, in its hunger for dominance, managed to steal four of these sacred documents but missed the two most crucial ones: Technology and Optimization. This creative storytelling serves to highlight what Pepeto’s developers see as their key technological advantages over their predecessor. Beyond the mythology, Pepeto introduces several practical features aimed at addressing common meme coin challenges. The project includes a staking system that rewards long-term holders, potentially helping to stabilize token prices. The staking rewards are available from the presale, currently rewarding users with over 300% APY. Those who join early might enjoy more rewards than those who join later on, as the reward is dynamic and could continue to reduce as more funds are sent into the staking pool. Pepeto will introduce a cross-chain bridge that aims to improve trading between different cryptocurrencies. It is created to use a lock-and-mint mechanism where assets are locked from the source chain and a corresponding amount is minted on the destination chain when carrying out transfer transactions. There is also a Pepeto exchange that offers zero fees for listing. Using the exchange also comes at no cost. The exchange is built to cover liquidity with easy access to various meme coins. However, entry will be by merit. The ease of entry is meant to boost liquidity on the platform. There are also various activities to ensure that Pepeto Exchange offers top security and enhanced protection. Scam-prone tokens won’t be listed on the platform to continuously protect the users. Various factors point to the possibility of PEPETO being a 100x token following its presale. Let’s look at some of them one after the other. One of the factors that suggest the token could see some major increases after the presale is the ongoing presale success. The presale has seen more than $4.7 million in funding, with more investors expected to come into the ecosystem with time. This large funding within the ecosystem suggests that investors believe in what it offers. If this continues, it could help it see quick growth post-presale. Pepeto, the God of Frogs: “It’s Not Hype… It’s the Beginning of Something Bigger” – An Interstellar Moment in Crypto \U0001f517 : https://t.co/RyI7SlT0Mh pic.twitter.com/mjlMkwjH1z — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) December 17, 2024 Pepeto developers aim to list it on at least five exchanges following launch. This is expected to create some liquidity for the project and more visibility. Having these could position PEPETO for larger trading volumes and quick adoption. With Pepeto going ahead to offer utility that many meme coins lack, the project could let users see reasons to come into the ecosystem to carry out various bridging and exchange activities. This could give a reason for many investors to come back, potentially increasing the value of the token. The project also has plans to grow, with the structured roadmap detailed on its website. The roadmap is in four phases. The various plans emphasize community engagement and exchange listings. There will also be utility through its bridge and exchange features. The plans also cover sustainability initiatives through staking and continued marketing efforts. The developers believe their focus on technology and optimization will help Pepeto avoid the price volatility that has affected other meme coins. PEPETO token is priced at $0.000000112. Investors can participate using various cryptocurrencies, including ETH, USDT, and BNB, or even with credit card payments. The platform supports multiple wallet options, recommending MetaMask for desktop users and Best Wallet for mobile transactions. All investors need to do is connect their decentralized wallets to the website and follow the prompts to secure their desired number of tokens.

The group has been implicated in a series of major cryptocurrency thefts, including a record-breaking hack involving $1.5 billion in stolen funds. The controversy has sparked a broader debate about THORChain’s claims of being a fully decentralized protocol. Critics, including some validators, have argued that the network is not decentralized enough to withstand regulatory pressure or the demands of a truly permissionless system. TCB and others have pointed out that the protocol relies on a relatively small number of validators, making it more vulnerable to centralized influence. THORChain’s founder, John-Paul Thorbjornsen, has stated that the protocol’s nodes are designed to follow established rules and that any node unwilling to comply can be removed. While this ensures a degree of operational control, it also underscores the complexity of maintaining a balance between decentralization and effective governance. Thorbjornsen has further emphasized that THORChain nodes have not been directly implicated by authorities, and he asserts that the platform’s design is intended to enable open, permissionless swaps. Following this news, THORChain’s native token RUNE has seen a significant plummet, dropping by 14.3% in the past day to a current trading price of $1.31.

Thorbjornsen has further emphasized that THORChain nodes have not been directly implicated by authorities, and he asserts that the platform’s design is intended to enable open, permissionless swaps. Following this news, THORChain’s native token RUNE has seen a significant plummet, dropping by 14.3% in the past day to a current trading price of $1.31.

With prices fluctuating and investors seeking new opportunities, one overlooked crypto asset is showing signs of potential growth. Its distinct features and current market dynamics could position it as an unexpected frontrunner, compelling traders to reassess their investment strategies and explore fresh possibilities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Catzilla ($CATZILLA) is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore—a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it. Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Right now, it’s at Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, some investors are getting in now to lock in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. Secure $CATZILLA Now Before Its Price Surges Plenty of meme coins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides just viral appeal. A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than just crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: That mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes—which could help with long-term sustainability. The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any meme coin, it’s a speculative play—there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla more interesting than most meme coins that pop up and disappear. Whether it turns into a big winner depends on how well they execute on the roadmap, but it’s one to keep an eye on. Take Advantage of the $CATZILLA Surge Ethereum is currently in the $2667-$2915 range, showing signs of recovery. The nearest resistance level at $3009 suggests ETH could soon break past if bullish trends continue. The relative strength index is around 31, indicating it may be oversold and ready to bounce back. With a 22.79% drop in the past week, Ethereum is near its support level at $2513. If it rallies past $3009, the next target would be $3258. A move to this level would mean an increase of over 10%. While recent trends show a decline, the potential for growth is strong, with indicators suggesting an upward shift might be near. XRP currently oscillates between $2.44 and $2.74. Its RSI is at a low 35.11, signaling it might be oversold, which often precedes a price bounce. The recent trend shows XRP lost almost 25% over the week and 34% this month, but it soared over 250% in six months. Current indicators and the price range suggest XRP could target its nearest resistance at $2.90. If momentum builds, it might aim for a second level around $3.19. This potential rise equates to roughly 16% to 27% from its lower range. Though it faces downward pressure, bullish conditions could emerge with stronger demand and a rally across the crypto market. While ETH and XRP show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a promising meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale stages, the token provides governance features, rewards for loyalty and participation, and staking options to grow holdings passively. Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight for true financial freedom by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

With prices fluctuating and investors seeking new opportunities, one overlooked crypto asset is showing signs of potential growth. Its distinct features and current market dynamics could position it as an unexpected frontrunner, compelling traders to reassess their investment strategies and explore fresh possibilities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Catzilla ($CATZILLA) is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore—a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it. Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Right now, it’s at Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, some investors are getting in now to lock in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. Secure $CATZILLA Now Before Its Price Surges Plenty of meme coins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides just viral appeal. A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than just crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: That mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes—which could help with long-term sustainability. The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any meme coin, it’s a speculative play—there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla more interesting than most meme coins that pop up and disappear. Whether it turns into a big winner depends on how well they execute on the roadmap, but it’s one to keep an eye on. Take Advantage of the $CATZILLA Surge Ethereum is currently in the $2667-$2915 range, showing signs of recovery. The nearest resistance level at $3009 suggests ETH could soon break past if bullish trends continue. The relative strength index is around 31, indicating it may be oversold and ready to bounce back. With a 22.79% drop in the past week, Ethereum is near its support level at $2513. If it rallies past $3009, the next target would be $3258. A move to this level would mean an increase of over 10%. While recent trends show a decline, the potential for growth is strong, with indicators suggesting an upward shift might be near. XRP currently oscillates between $2.44 and $2.74. Its RSI is at a low 35.11, signaling it might be oversold, which often precedes a price bounce. The recent trend shows XRP lost almost 25% over the week and 34% this month, but it soared over 250% in six months. Current indicators and the price range suggest XRP could target its nearest resistance at $2.90. If momentum builds, it might aim for a second level around $3.19. This potential rise equates to roughly 16% to 27% from its lower range. Though it faces downward pressure, bullish conditions could emerge with stronger demand and a rally across the crypto market. While ETH and XRP show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a promising meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale stages, the token provides governance features, rewards for loyalty and participation, and staking options to grow holdings passively. Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight for true financial freedom by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

An expert suggested that the upcoming bill could take longer than expected as the parliament considers lower taxation. In a Thursday interview with local news media, Taras Kozak, a member of Ukraine’s securities regulator advisory group, shared new details on Ukraine’s efforts to legalize cryptocurrencies this year, the potential timeline, and tax rates on digital assets’ income. The expert disagreed with Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, who forecasted the bill would be passed in the coming months. On February 7, the lawmaker said the government was working to ensure the crypto law was adopted by summer 2025. Hetmantsev added that the first draft would be “ready for a first reading in the first quarter” of the year, followed by a second reading in Parliament. However, he noted that the lawmakers are still working on the details related to the crypto taxation measures. As reported by Bitcoinist, Hetmantsev announced in December that the Parliament’s working group was working alongside the National Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a draft bill to be introduced in early 2025, aiming to legalize digital assets in the first half of the year. Kozak disagreed with the lawmaker’s timeline, stating that crypto’s legalization in Ukraine could take until next year. According to the report, the expert is optimistic that the long-awaited bill will pass all the readings in the Verkhovna Rada and be signed by the end of this year. Under this timeline, crypto would be legalized, and income from digital assets could be taxed starting in 2026. The expert affirmed that the final tax rate is key, as Ukrainian investors and businesses using crypto “are not against replenishing the state budget.” According to Kozak, Ukrainians are willing to pay around a 5% tax on their crypto income, but the taxation cannot be delayed anymore. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the “On Virtual Assets” law in March 2022, setting the legal framework for regulating the country’s digital asset market. However, the law has not been implemented as it awaits amendments to the Ukrainian Tax Code. This\xa0resulted in the loss of millions in potential tax revenue, as the absence of regulations meant that exchanges had no legal obligations to pay taxes to the Ukrainian authorities for the revenue obtained from crypto assets. Kozak suggested implementing a small tax, “from 5% to 10%. All citizen income should be taxed because our state lives on this money, our army fights, we buy weapons, and we maintain security,” he stated. The report affirms the government is considering a standard rate of 18% on personal income plus a 5% military levy. Additionally, investors who can’t prove their initial investments could face up to a 23% tax on their total holdings. Hetmantsev previously explained that tax exemptions won’t be applied to digital assets as they are taking a “very cautious approach to using cryptocurrencies for tax exemptions” after consulting with the IMF and European experts.'}
